We use it to document the processes that underpin our company behind our software. Its purpose is to **iteratively increase clarity** for Mattermost staff and community co-building the future of our company and our offerings, and provide a single-source of truth.\n\nEarly in our history, when we were a much smaller company, our staff handbook was included in our product documentation. Now the Handbook lives in the the dedicated repository at [https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook) which is edited using GitBook as a frontend.\n\nWant to contribute to the Handbook? Start here: [How to update the Handbook](company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-update-handbook.md).\n\nAll documentation is available under the terms of a [Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).\n\nSome norms you'll see here in the Handbook:\n\n## Growing companies are a work-in-progress\n\nIt's Day 1 at Mattermost. We're a growing company and growing open source project out to support the massive transformation underway as open source software unlocks the massive potential of people and teams around the world. As an open source company we like to share early. Sharing ideas early gets us feedback sooner, so we can iterate faster, so we can better results.\n\nOn some pages, you'll see reference to [1% and 50% drafts](company/about-mattermost/mindsets.md#drafts-at-1-50-99). This is used to express how complete our thinking is around the published content, and indicate whether fundamental changes may be made.\n\nWhen a section of the handbook is at less than the 50% draft stage you should see it labeled in the page description with the % draft status. When a section doesn't have a % draft status, assume it's over the 50% draft stage.\n\nWe believe this system has two key benefits:\n\n1. **Be more open to feedback and iteration:** Having something published publicly can make it seem overly \"final\". By having pages in our handbook at 1% and 50% we make it easier to go through feedback and iteration cycles.\n2. **Engage more non-technical people in the discussion:** In the past, we've done reviews largely in GitHub pull requests, which is friendly and familiar for technical team members, but more difficult for others. Sharing 1% and 50% drafts in the public for feedback makes our process more inclusive.\n\nThere are trade-offs as well: There may be confusion among people who haven't been onboarded into the [1%, 50% draft](company/about-mattermost/mindsets.md#drafts-at-1-50-99) concept. People who aren't comfortable with the level of early sharing may feel upset. For these reasons, this page itself is only a 10% draft, so opinions can be expressed and discussed.\n\n## Sharing feedback and updating the handbook\n\nFeedback on this handbook is immensely appreciated. There are two ways you can share your feedback:\n\n1. You can create an issue in the [Handbook repository](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/issues). Select **New issue**, and provide as much detail as possible in the issue. Screenshots and links are also welcome. Choose **Submit new issue**. The [Handbook channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/handbook) receives a notification and this begins the cycle of feedback and iteration. While not all feedback will result in an update to the handbook, we definitely want to hear everyone's opinion.\n2. You can edit the page directly, and submit your feedback/suggested changes as a Pull Request \\(PR\\). PRs go through the same cycle of feedback and iteration. The only difference is that an issue is not an immediate change and may take longer to action. A PR already contains the changes, and has a quicker turnaround time.

Help engage with contributor questions in channels\n\n### Weekly\n\n1. Participate in team triage/planning meetings\n2.

SDET \\(Software Development Engineer in Test, the test engineers in QA\\) rotation to monitor nightly automated tests and investigate and update as needed \\(see below\\)\n2. Oversee your team's release testing and QA-approve releases \\(cadence may vary by team/product\\)\n3. \\(QA Platform\\) Detox mobile release testing and maintenance\n\n### As needed\n\n1. Develop test plans for new features, add test cases to Zephyr test management\n2. Approve new features after manual testing passes\n3. \\(QA Platform\\) Oversee testing infrastructure and server needs\n4. Help tend to community campaigns such as test automation Hackathons and QA community feature testing\n5. Add or update documentation as you find need or opportunity\n\n## PR reviews\n\n1. PR author adds `3: QA Review` label to every PR\n2. PR author adds a specific QA person as a reviewer _after_ PM/UX and dev reviews are done\n   * Exceptions can be made for general smoke testing or other agreed-upon scenarios when it makes sense for QA review to be done in parallel with other reviewers\n   * QA review assignee defaults to the QA person on that team\n3. Read through the PR and its associated Jira ticket to establish context\n4. Create a test build if needed\n   * Labels can be added to trigger test builds for webapp/server, mobile apps\n   * Test server info auto-posts in a comment on the PR\n   * Mobile test builds auto-post in [QA: Builds](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/qa-builds) channel; uninstall existing Mattermost app from your device, and install the test build from APK file or pList link\n   * Desktop: Ask for a test build or new RC on the PR or request in the [Developers: Desktop App](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/desktop-app) channel \n5. Establish or verify test plan and scope if not already spelled out\n   * Can use [Test Plan Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16w9jMWXRRjuBbkF923Qka02UQyjF5_QI9skNEBb4fQQ) as appropriate, especially for major features\n   * Ensure test cases are added or updated in Zephyr test management\n   * For most PRs/bug fixes, note test details in the PR and related JIRA ticket \\(no separate document needed\\)\n6. Ask questions and report issues in comments on the PR, mentioning the PR author \\(and the PM/another dev as needed\\)\n7. Request changes as part of the Review Changes flow in GitHub, which can make it easier to manage in your PR to-do list\n8. Verify unit and E2E tests are present and provide adequate coverage\n   * If needed, add comment mentioning the author to ask about adding tests\n   * Important: Ensure that E2E tests contain the proper mapping key to connect with Zephyr test management\n9. Note that some pre-approved scenarios such as many Server team PRs that don't require QA testing may use the label `QA Deferred` \n10. When complete, select **Review Changes**, add comment, and approve\n11. Remove label `3: QA Review`\n12. If other reviews are still open, add label `QA Review Done`\n13. If yours was the last review \\(commonly the case\\), add label `4: Reviews Done`\n    * You may be the one to merge the PR if you're the last reviewer; this varies by team\n14. On the related Jira ticket, assign yourself as QA Assignee\n\n## Verifying and closing resolved Jira tickets\n\n1. [QA-Assigned to you, not-closed](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=15192)\n2. Handling various ticket resolutions\n   * `Won't Fix`, `Won't Do`, `Invalid`: Leave in Resolved \\(PMs go through these periodically\\)\n   * `Duplicate`: Ensure the duplicate ticket is linked in a comment and close as duplicate\n   * `Done`: Test according to test steps / test plan as appropriate\n3. May not need to re-test for self-managed release if already satisfactorily tested for previous Cloud release\n4. Be sure to test across Web App, Mobile apps, and Desktop App\n5. Ensure it is noted in the ticket and test case if any of the expected behavior or the bug itself was environment-specific \\(e.g. Android-only, Safari-only, etc.\\)\n6. Ensure related Zephyr test cases are linked to the ticket for traceability \\(can link to the test case from the ticket in the Zephyr section of the ticket\\)\n7. Update test cases in Zephyr as needed\n8. Always leave a comment on the Zephyr test case explaining your changes\n9. Add a link to the related ticket in the test step field, as it allows testers an easy way to see if it\u2019s a known issue or perhaps a \u201cWon\u2019t Fix\u201d situation.\n\n   And triple-check that the test case shows the related ticket in Traceability\n\n10. Issues found? Communicate with the dev Assignee and either reopen or file a new ticket as desired. Can at-mention the Assignee in a comment and/or in a channel to discuss what's best\n11. Tested and all passed? Note testing results in a comment and close the ticket\n12. Leaving open to re-test on other fix versions\n    * If you test on Cloud and want to re-test when the next self-managed RC is cut, add label `done-cloud` and leave in `Resolved`\n    * If a hotfix is being backported to additional versions, add `done-5.38` for example, as the fix is tested on each version\n    * Also always leave a comment explaining what testing has been completed and what is left to test \n\n## UI test automation\n\n1. [Help drive and write E2E tests for your team](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/webapp/end-to-end-tests/)\n2. Happy path for new features and bug fixes should be written or updated by the dev writing the feature or fix\n3. Help to review E2E submissions and to add tests for more in-depth test cases\n4. Ensure test case keys from Zephyr test cases are included in E2E tests\n5. Help maintain nightly automated tests\n   * Monitored by SDET on weekly rotation\n   * See [QA: UI Test Automation](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/ui-test-automation) channel and [QA: Test Automation Reports](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/qa-test-automation-reports) channel\n   * Test failures can be routed to the appropriate team, but SDET rotation can help monitor and answer questions\n   * Demote and promote nightly tests from and to production as needed\n6. Help review and shepherd community contributions\n   * [E2E help-wanted issues available for contributors](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Up+For+Grabs%22+label%3A%22Area%2FE2E+Tests%22+)\n7.

        "content": "# Rainforest Process Notes\n\n## Running tests, reviewing failures, and commenting in Zephyr\n\n\n* [Run groups](#run-groups)\n  * [Which run groups to run for which release?](#which-run-groups-to-run-for-which-release)\n* [Webhook for reporting to Zephyr](#webhook-for-reporting-to-zephyr)\n* [Preparing a run group to run](#preparing-a-run-group-to-run)\n* [Reviewing failures](#reviewing-failures)\n  * [Crowd-tested run groups](#crowd-tested-run-groups)\n  * [Automated run groups](#automated-run-groups)\n* [Commenting on test failures in Zephyr](#commenting-on-test-failures-in-zephyr)\n\n## [Run groups](https://app.rainforestqa.com/run_groups)\n\n### Which run groups to run for which release?\n\n**Note**: The **browser** tests for Cloud releases have been split into groups as the original groups were getting too big. For releases going out in the first half of the month, run the **(1st Half of Month)** groups. Similarly, for releases going out in the second half of the month, run the **(2nd Half of Month)** groups.\n\n1. Self-managed releases\n   \n    a. All run groups starting with **(RFA) Browser_**.\n\n2. Mobile releases\n   \n    a. All run groups starting with **Android_** and **iOS_**.\n\n3. Cloud releases\n   \n    a. All run groups starting with **Cloud Workspace_**.\n\n**Additional notes**\n   \n* Run groups starting with **Browser_** are the old crowd-tested groups. Once conversion of all groups to Rainforest automation (RFA) is complete, these groups will be deprecated.\n  \n* Currently, we are not running any Desktop App tests in Rainforest.\n\n## Webhook for reporting to Zephyr\n\nBefore setting off any group of tests to run, the webhook must be enabled in Rainforest so that it reports to Zephyr. See the [wiki](https://wiki-internal.mattermost.cloud/quality) for details. To set the webhook, go to the [Sites page](https://app.rainforestqa.com/settings/sites) in Rainforest.\n\n1. Click on **Staging**:\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image1.png)\n\n2. Check the box to the left of **Webhook Enabled**, then click on the **Save** button:\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image2.png)\n\n3. The webhook is now enabled and all runs set off after enabling it will report to Zephyr in the folder [Rainforest Tests](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/projects/MM?selectedItem=com.atlassian.plugins.atlassian-connect-plugin:com.kanoah.test-manager__main-project-page#!/cycle?projectId=10302).\n\n4. Running results in this folder will have the same title with run ID as the run group you set off e.g. **<Run ID>: Android - Account Settings**, so all you need to do is drag and drop it to the release folder it belongs to. \n\n## Preparing a run group to run\n\n1. Go to [https://app.rainforestqa.com/run_groups](https://app.rainforestqa.com/run_groups).\n   \n2. Click on the run group you want to run e.g. **Android - Account Settings**.\n   \n3. You will see this screen:\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image3.png)\n\n4. Click on the blue **Run** button, top right of the screen. You\u2019ll then see this screen:\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image4.png)\n\n5. Click on **Additional Options** bottom left. You\u2019ll then see this screen:\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image5.png)\n\n6. Type the release name into the **Should this run be tied to your release process** field. e.g. v1.50 release.\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image6.png)\n\n7. Click the back arrow to the left of **Additional Options** which will take you back to this screen:\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image7.png)\n\n8. Scroll down so that **Platform** is visible and check that the correct platform to test on is selected (for mobile runs, you can click on **Mobile VM** to display only the mobile options).\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image8.png)\n\n9. Once you are certain that the correct platform is selected, (for this example Android 12.0 (Beta) is correct), click on **Start Run**.\n    \n10. The run will begin and you can view results here: [https://app.rainforestqa.com/runs?page=1&mode=standard](https://app.rainforestqa.com/runs?page=1&mode=standard).\n   \n**Note:** On the run results page, you can set a filter to show only \u201cStandard\u201d runs to filter out any draft runs.\n\n## Reviewing failures\n\n### Crowd-tested run groups\n\n1. From this page: [https://app.rainforestqa.com/runs?page=1&mode=standard](https://app.rainforestqa.com/runs?page=1&mode=standard), click on the run group you want to review. For this example, we\u2019ll use the **Android - Account Settings**.\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image9.png)\n\n2. You\u2019ll be taken to this screen:\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image10.png)\n\n3. Notice that 2 tests failed. Click on the first test that failed. You\u2019ll be taken to this screen:\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image11.png)\n\n4. Scroll down until you see a red **X** to the right of the step that failed, then click on the **X**.\n   \n    **Note**: Sometimes one crowd tester will get further along in a test than another tester, so there may be more than one point of failure, as there is in this example. In cases like this, click on both **X**\u2019s to see what failed.\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image12.png)\n\n    **Let\u2019s look at the failure in the first red X.**\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image13.png)\n\n    You can see that 2 testers passed the step but one tester failed the step due to the language in Mattermost not being in English. (This sometimes happens when previous testers have not reset the app to English before ending the test). In cases like this, add a comment that this was the case.\n\n    **Let\u2019s look at the failure in the 2nd red X.**\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image14.png)\n\n    You can see that one tester failed the step as he didn\u2019t know how to change the language back to English in the incognito browser window. In this case, he did not read the instructions or follow them as they read: \u201cDo you see language change to Chinese in the Mobile app? IMPORTANT: IF THIS STEP FAILS, do not LEAVE THE TEST BEFORE CHANGING THE LANGUAGE BACK TO ENGLISH IN THE INCOGNITO WINDOW BY FOLLOWING STEPS 9 AND 10\u201d.\n\n5. When it starts to look like testers are confused, open the test and preview it to ensure instructions are clear and test steps are correct. To do this, click on **Open Test** at the top of the screen.\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image15.png)\n\n    a. Once you\u2019ve clicked on **Open Test**, the test will open in a new browser window. Click on the **Preview** button at the top of the screen.\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image16.png)\n\n    b. In preview mode, the platform is not selected, and you need to do this before previewing the test. In this example, we need to click on **Android 12**. Once you\u2019ve selected the platform, click on the blue **Preview** button bottom right of the screen.\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image17.png)\n\n    c. A new browser window will open showing the test preview window. Click on **I understand** and go ahead with previewing the test.\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image18.png)\n\n    d. The test preview is exactly as the testers would see it as they are testing. Usually, it's helpful to have the test open in another window to edit any steps that are unclear as I go through the preview.\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image19.png)\n\n6. Once you have previewed the test (and made any updates to the test itself), go back to the failed test in the run group. For this example, it\u2019s this page: [https://app.rainforestqa.com/runs/880602/tests/237283/browsers/android_phone_12/steps/103213942](https://app.rainforestqa.com/runs/880602/tests/237283/browsers/android_phone_12/steps/103213942). As these examples have already been reviewed and categorized, you can see that I refactored this test for clarity but, if you were reviewing the test on failure, you\u2019d:\n\n    a. Click on the **Categorize Failure** button, top right of the screen.\n  \n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image20.png)\n\n    b. Select **Needs Refactor**, then click on the blue **Next** button (the option to refactor the test yourself is already checked).\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image21.png)\n\n    c. Type in your comments/reason for refactor, then click the blue **Save** button.\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image22.png)\n\n    d. Once you\u2019ve clicked **Save**, you will see that the **Categorize Failure** button has changed to **Categorized: Needs Refactor**.\n   \n**Note:** Although the button shows NEEDS REFACTOR, you have already refactored the test. To see tests that have been categorized to Needs Refactor, go to the [Dashboard](https://app.rainforestqa.com/dashboard). Here you can click the radio buttons to the left of the tests that you\u2019ve categorized as Needs Refactor and they will disappear from the screen. This is the process I\u2019ve followed as it\u2019s easier for me to refactor the test as I\u2019m reviewing failures. If you\u2019d prefer to review all tests first then go to the Dashboard and work through the tests you need to refactor, that\u2019s also totally possible :)\n        \n![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image23.png)\n\n![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image24.png)\n\nTo review the next failure in a run group, you can click on the **Next Failure** or **Previous Failure** buttons at the bottom of the screen. Once all failures have been reviewed, these buttons are both grayed out.\n\n![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image25.png)\n\n### Automated run groups\n\n1. From this page, click on the run group you want to review failures in: [https://app.rainforestqa.com/runs?page=1&mode=standard](https://app.rainforestqa.com/runs?page=1&mode=standard). For this example, we\u2019ll look at **(RFA) Browser - Multi-Team & DM (Mac/Catalina)**.\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image26.png)\n\n2. You\u2019ll be taken to this page. Click on the first failed test.\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image27.png)\n\n3. This page will open and automatically scroll to the failed step, showing the corresponding UI on the right-hand side.\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image28.png)\n\n4. At first glance, this seemed to be a bug as Team Open was not in view. However, when reviewing previous steps in the automated test run, I couldn\u2019t work out why the test had failed. Sometimes it\u2019s difficult to see exactly what was clicked on in the automated replay. In this instance, I opened the test and ran a preview. To do this, click on the **Open Test** option, top right of the screen.\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image29.png)\n\n5. You\u2019ll be taken to the test preview page. Once the VM has loaded on the right-hand-side, click the **Select All** button, top left of the screen then manually deselect the first 2 steps as these are to load the VM to the starting page.\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image30.png)\n\n6. Click on the blue **Preview xx Actions** button and the automated preview of the test will start. If any step fails while you are previewing, you can determine why, recapture the screenshot, add in a \u201cwait\u201d step, etc etc. We can do some practice runs to review automated failures :)\n\n7. For this particular example, I ran the test preview and it passed so I categorized this test as **Other** as I had no idea why the test had failed in the run.\n\n8. To review the next failure in the run group, click on the **Next Failure** or **Previous Failure** options at the bottom of the screen.\n\n## Commenting on test failures in Zephyr\n\nHaving enabled the webhook before running tests and with the run groups having completed, results will be posted in the [~QA: Rainforest Results channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/rainforest-test-run-results) in Mattermost as well as the [Rainforest Tests folder](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/projects/MM?selectedItem=com.atlassian.plugins.atlassian-connect-plugin:com.kanoah.test-manager__main-project-page#!/cycle?projectId=10302) in Zephyr. \n\n**Note**: The run groups in Zephyr can be dragged and dropped to the release folder they belong to.\n\nFor ease of workflow, I usually have the failed test, the group of results in ~QA: Rainforest Results channel and the run group in Zephyr open.\n\nRAINFOREST\n\n![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image31.png)\n\nMATTERMOST\n\n![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image32.png)\n\nZEPHYR\n\n![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image33.png)\n\nWe will use the example run above to explain the commenting process in Zephyr:\n\n1. The test in Rainforest (RF-B577 MM-T4173 - Boards Plugin - (Mac/Catalina) - Empty Board - Groups) failed due to browser rendering issues since Rainforest updated the browsers on their VMs so, after updating the screenshot, the test can be categorized as \u201cSystem Issues\u201d as per screenshot below:\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image34.png)\n\n2. In Mattermost, reply to the run group with failures in it, for this example, Boards Plugin - macOS, and start a thread giving reasons for failures:\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image35.png)\n\n3. In Zephyr, find the failed test (for this example \u201cBoards App - Empty Board - Groups\u201d), then click on **Start a new test execution**:\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image36.png)\n\n4. Click on **Not executed** and select **Comment**. This will put a pink bar to the left of the test.\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image37.png)\n\n5. In the **Comment** field, add a reason for the failure (in this example, browser rendering issues).\n\n    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image38.png)\n\n6. Continue with the process above until all failures have been commented in Zephyr.\n\n    **Note**:  Of course, if the failure was due to a bug, it will remain in the \u201cFail\u201d status in Zephyr and you can add a link to the Jira bug ticket in the Comment field. (No need to \u201cStart a new test execution\u201d for failures due to actual bugs).\n",

For this example, we\u2019ll use the <strong>Android - Account Settings</strong>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image9.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You\u2019ll be taken to this screen:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image10.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Notice that 2 tests failed. Click on the first test that failed. You\u2019ll be taken to this screen:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image11.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scroll down until you see a red <strong>X</strong> to the right of the step that failed, then click on the <strong>X</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Sometimes one crowd tester will get further along in a test than another tester, so there may be more than one point of failure, as there is in this example. In cases like this, click on both <strong>X</strong>\u2019s to see what failed.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image12.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Let\u2019s look at the failure in the first red X.</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image13.png\" /></p>\n<p>You can see that 2 testers passed the step but one tester failed the step due to the language in Mattermost not being in English. (This sometimes happens when previous testers have not reset the app to English before ending the test). In cases like this, add a comment that this was the case.</p>\n<p><strong>Let\u2019s look at the failure in the 2nd red X.</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image14.png\" /></p>\n<p>You can see that one tester failed the step as he didn\u2019t know how to change the language back to English in the incognito browser window. In this case, he did not read the instructions or follow them as they read: \u201cDo you see language change to Chinese in the Mobile app? IMPORTANT: IF THIS STEP FAILS, do not LEAVE THE TEST BEFORE CHANGING THE LANGUAGE BACK TO ENGLISH IN THE INCOGNITO WINDOW BY FOLLOWING STEPS 9 AND 10\u201d.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When it starts to look like testers are confused, open the test and preview it to ensure instructions are clear and test steps are correct. To do this, click on <strong>Open Test</strong> at the top of the screen.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image15.png\" /></p>\n<p>a. Once you\u2019ve clicked on <strong>Open Test</strong>, the test will open in a new browser window. Click on the <strong>Preview</strong> button at the top of the screen.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image16.png\" /></p>\n<p>b. In preview mode, the platform is not selected, and you need to do this before previewing the test. In this example, we need to click on <strong>Android 12</strong>. Once you\u2019ve selected the platform, click on the blue <strong>Preview</strong> button bottom right of the screen.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image17.png\" /></p>\n<p>c. A new browser window will open showing the test preview window. Click on <strong>I understand</strong> and go ahead with previewing the test.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image18.png\" /></p>\n<p>d. The test preview is exactly as the testers would see it as they are testing. Usually, it's helpful to have the test open in another window to edit any steps that are unclear as I go through the preview.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image19.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once you have previewed the test (and made any updates to the test itself), go back to the failed test in the run group. For this example, it\u2019s this page: <a href=\"https://app.rainforestqa.com/runs/880602/tests/237283/browsers/android_phone_12/steps/103213942\">https://app.rainforestqa.com/runs/880602/tests/237283/browsers/android_phone_12/steps/103213942</a>. As these examples have already been reviewed and categorized, you can see that I refactored this test for clarity but, if you were reviewing the test on failure, you\u2019d:</p>\n<p>a. Click on the <strong>Categorize Failure</strong> button, top right of the screen.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image20.png\" /></p>\n<p>b. Select <strong>Needs Refactor</strong>, then click on the blue <strong>Next</strong> button (the option to refactor the test yourself is already checked).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image21.png\" /></p>\n<p>c. Type in your comments/reason for refactor, then click the blue <strong>Save</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image22.png\" /></p>\n<p>d. Once you\u2019ve clicked <strong>Save</strong>, you will see that the <strong>Categorize Failure</strong> button has changed to <strong>Categorized: Needs Refactor</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the button shows NEEDS REFACTOR, you have already refactored the test. To see tests that have been categorized to Needs Refactor, go to the <a href=\"https://app.rainforestqa.com/dashboard\">Dashboard</a>. Here you can click the radio buttons to the left of the tests that you\u2019ve categorized as Needs Refactor and they will disappear from the screen. This is the process I\u2019ve followed as it\u2019s easier for me to refactor the test as I\u2019m reviewing failures. If you\u2019d prefer to review all tests first then go to the Dashboard and work through the tests you need to refactor, that\u2019s also totally possible :)</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image23.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image24.png\" /></p>\n<p>To review the next failure in a run group, you can click on the <strong>Next Failure</strong> or <strong>Previous Failure</strong> buttons at the bottom of the screen. Once all failures have been reviewed, these buttons are both grayed out.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image25.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Automated run groups</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>From this page, click on the run group you want to review failures in: <a href=\"https://app.rainforestqa.com/runs?page=1&amp;mode=standard\">https://app.rainforestqa.com/runs?page=1&amp;mode=standard</a>. For this example, we\u2019ll look at <strong>(RFA) Browser - Multi-Team &amp; DM (Mac/Catalina)</strong>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image26.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You\u2019ll be taken to this page. Click on the first failed test.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image27.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This page will open and automatically scroll to the failed step, showing the corresponding UI on the right-hand side.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image28.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At first glance, this seemed to be a bug as Team Open was not in view. However, when reviewing previous steps in the automated test run, I couldn\u2019t work out why the test had failed. Sometimes it\u2019s difficult to see exactly what was clicked on in the automated replay. In this instance, I opened the test and ran a preview. To do this, click on the <strong>Open Test</strong> option, top right of the screen.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image29.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You\u2019ll be taken to the test preview page. Once the VM has loaded on the right-hand-side, click the <strong>Select All</strong> button, top left of the screen then manually deselect the first 2 steps as these are to load the VM to the starting page.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image30.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click on the blue <strong>Preview xx Actions</strong> button and the automated preview of the test will start. If any step fails while you are previewing, you can determine why, recapture the screenshot, add in a \u201cwait\u201d step, etc etc. We can do some practice runs to review automated failures :)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For this particular example, I ran the test preview and it passed so I categorized this test as <strong>Other</strong> as I had no idea why the test had failed in the run.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To review the next failure in the run group, click on the <strong>Next Failure</strong> or <strong>Previous Failure</strong> options at the bottom of the screen.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Commenting on test failures in Zephyr</h2>\n<p>Having enabled the webhook before running tests and with the run groups having completed, results will be posted in the <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/rainforest-test-run-results\">~QA: Rainforest Results channel</a> in Mattermost as well as the <a href=\"https://mattermost.atlassian.net/projects/MM?selectedItem=com.atlassian.plugins.atlassian-connect-plugin:com.kanoah.test-manager__main-project-page#!/cycle?projectId=10302\">Rainforest Tests folder</a> in Zephyr. </p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The run groups in Zephyr can be dragged and dropped to the release folder they belong to.</p>\n<p>For ease of workflow, I usually have the failed test, the group of results in ~QA: Rainforest Results channel and the run group in Zephyr open.</p>\n<p>RAINFOREST</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image31.png\" /></p>\n<p>MATTERMOST</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image32.png\" /></p>\n<p>ZEPHYR</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image33.png\" /></p>\n<p>We will use the example run above to explain the commenting process in Zephyr:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The test in Rainforest (RF-B577 MM-T4173 - Boards Plugin - (Mac/Catalina) - Empty Board - Groups) failed due to browser rendering issues since Rainforest updated the browsers on their VMs so, after updating the screenshot, the test can be categorized as \u201cSystem Issues\u201d as per screenshot below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image34.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In Mattermost, reply to the run group with failures in it, for this example, Boards Plugin - macOS, and start a thread giving reasons for failures:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image35.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In Zephyr, find the failed test (for this example \u201cBoards App - Empty Board - Groups\u201d), then click on <strong>Start a new test execution</strong>:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image36.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click on <strong>Not executed</strong> and select <strong>Comment</strong>. This will put a pink bar to the left of the test.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image37.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the <strong>Comment</strong> field, add a reason for the failure (in this example, browser rendering issues).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/rainforest_image38.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Continue with the process above until all failures have been commented in Zephyr.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>:  Of course, if the failure was due to a bug, it will remain in the \u201cFail\u201d status in Zephyr and you can add a link to the Jira bug ticket in the Comment field.

        "title": "Developer Relations",
        "content": "# Developer Relations\n\nDeveloper Relations and community outreach can take on many forms and is a constantly evolving practice. At Mattermost, our focus is always on our community of administrators, developers, and end users.\n\nEvery member of the internal Mattermost team participates in Developer Relations. This can be as a formal member of the Community Team or as a casual participant in community activities such as discussions on the community server, discussions at external events, or other interactions with non-internal community members.\n\nSome activities that fall under formal Developer Relations:\n\n* Conference and meetup presentations\n* Podcasts\n* Webinars\n* Content creation and distribution\n* Forum and discussion participation\n\nPlease reach out to the [Community Team](mailto:community@mattermost.com) if you have any questions or would like assistance for any activities in their milieu.\n\n## How to staff an event booth\n\nWhether working in the virtual space during the pandemic or working an in-person event, there are some guidelines we need to be aware of when it comes to our interaction with current and potential users at events. These tips are a list of best practices and can be improved upon as we further our reach on events. Feedback on how to improve this list is always welcome.\n\n### Shifts\n\nOne of the most difficult parts of event engagement is ensuring we have coverage for our presence, but also ensuring no one gets burned out or exhausted by a deluge of inquiries.\n\n* **One hour on, one hour off:** To give everyone a chance to avoid constant bombardment, especially at in-person events, anyone staffing the booth should plan to have one hour on duty followed by one hour off. This also gives folks a chance to look into other parts of the event, consolidate notes on interactions, and unwind and refresh a bit.\n* **No solo heroes:** There should, at no time, be a person working the booth alone. This may be unavoidable at times but we need to endeavor to avoid this situation. While someone may be amazing at entertaining multiple booth visitors, it does not indicate they won\u2019t become overwhelmed, run out of resources, or be able to maintain that level.\n\n### Etiquette\n\nMattermosties are kind and considerate. We have a sense of humor and are generally good natured. We adhere to our internal Code of Conduct and the CoC\u2019s of the events we are a part of. That said, there are some tips to make for a better experience when interacting with folks at events.\n\n* **Respect their time:** Understand that most conversations at a booth last only a few minutes. Basic questions are addressed, like what we do, how do we compare to COMPETITOR X, and other straightforward ideas. There isn\u2019t a need to go too deep on technical detail unless they specifically inquire about it. Most conversations will occur in 4 minutes or less. If things go deeper and they seem comfortable, continue the conversation. If it goes too deep, recommend connecting later during the conference or maybe chatting on the Mattermost community server after the event.\n* **No Hard Pitching:** Most people understand what our goals are at an event. The chances of closing the deal, even at a large scale, enterprise event, are nearly nil. A hard press often disaffects potential clients. Especially with the tech-minded.\n* **Be aware of cultural differences:** Occasionally there are cultural norms that change the course of conversation. Some examples include the reserved nature of many Scandinavian cultures or the brash, \u201cwe know this\u201d nature of Americans. While no one expects you to obtain a minor in Cultural Anthropology or Sociology, be aware of certain norms from cultures outside your own.\n* **Assume everyone is an expert:** Regardless of any outward appearance, assume everyone we interact with has been working in their field and has top-level expertise. We do not assume anyone is junior or not tech-minded for any reason. They are approaching us with some level of interest. Let\u2019s work to keep that interest kindled.\n\n### Definitions\n\n* Event Engaged Attendee\n  * **Virtual:** Any attendee who attends a talk or visits the booth interactively. This can include volunteering their information directly or having it provided by the organizers post-event.\n  * **In-person:** Any attendee who attends a talk, offers their information at a booth or other station, interacts with any Mattermost representative with intent on further examining Mattermost. Interactions to simply look at Mattermost or to discuss philosophies of Mattermost may notbe considered \"engaged\" - this can be left to the respresentatives discretion.\n* Talk\n  * Any keynote, speech, presentation, demo, or workshop given at an external event \\(or at MatterCon\\).\n\n### Assets\n\n* [Conference/Trip Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10AZQP5QaUHOd-cuiogA08TD6Im0XvS1qpOBIDcnJScI/edit?usp=sharing): To be used after speaking at an event or participating as a sponsor or in a sales or marketing capacity.\n\n### Process for inviting staff to events\n\n1. Allocate available passes to each department - e.g. 1 Eng, 1 Product, 1 Support, 2 Sales/CS, 1 Marketing. Allocation is typically based on\n  - **Goal of an event** For example, if the main goal is to generate sales leads, we'd have a bigger sales/marketing presence. If the main goal is product or community awareness, then a bigger engineering/product presence.\n  - **Audience** For example, if the audience is mostly users (devs, etc), then we tend to bring more community, product or engineering folks. Usually aligned with the goal of an event, but not always. An example is FOSDEM where we only bring the community team and engineers.\n2. Based on allocation, create a list of specific individuals we'd like to invite.\n  - Prioritize those who have expressed interested in attending events.\n  - Prioritize those who are geographically close (lower costs, less time and effort for folks to attend).\n  - Prioritize specific needs, e.g. for KubeCon, we have previously invited engineers who worked on our Kubernetes operator and Cloud platform, instead of other engineers. For security events it has been our security engineers, etc.\n3. Once we have an invite list:\n  - Reach out to their manager asking if they are okay for us to pull a headcount for the event.\n  - If either the MLT/manager or individual says no, ask who they'd recommend instead.\n4. Invite each person individually.\n",

This can be as a formal member of the Community Team or as a casual participant in community activities such as discussions on the community server, discussions at external events, or other interactions with non-internal community members.</p>\n<p>Some activities that fall under formal Developer Relations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conference and meetup presentations</li>\n<li>Podcasts</li>\n<li>Webinars</li>\n<li>Content creation and distribution</li>\n<li>Forum and discussion participation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please reach out to the <a href=\"mailto:community@mattermost.com\">Community Team</a> if you have any questions or would like assistance for any activities in their milieu.</p>\n<h2>How to staff an event booth</h2>\n<p>Whether working in the virtual space during the pandemic or working an in-person event, there are some guidelines we need to be aware of when it comes to our interaction with current and potential users at events. These tips are a list of best practices and can be improved upon as we further our reach on events. Feedback on how to improve this list is always welcome.</p>\n<h3>Shifts</h3>\n<p>One of the most difficult parts of event engagement is ensuring we have coverage for our presence, but also ensuring no one gets burned out or exhausted by a deluge of inquiries.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One hour on, one hour off:</strong> To give everyone a chance to avoid constant bombardment, especially at in-person events, anyone staffing the booth should plan to have one hour on duty followed by one hour off. This also gives folks a chance to look into other parts of the event, consolidate notes on interactions, and unwind and refresh a bit.</li>\n<li><strong>No solo heroes:</strong> There should, at no time, be a person working the booth alone. This may be unavoidable at times but we need to endeavor to avoid this situation. While someone may be amazing at entertaining multiple booth visitors, it does not indicate they won\u2019t become overwhelmed, run out of resources, or be able to maintain that level.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Etiquette</h3>\n<p>Mattermosties are kind and considerate. We have a sense of humor and are generally good natured. We adhere to our internal Code of Conduct and the CoC\u2019s of the events we are a part of. That said, there are some tips to make for a better experience when interacting with folks at events.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Respect their time:</strong> Understand that most conversations at a booth last only a few minutes. Basic questions are addressed, like what we do, how do we compare to COMPETITOR X, and other straightforward ideas. There isn\u2019t a need to go too deep on technical detail unless they specifically inquire about it. Most conversations will occur in 4 minutes or less. If things go deeper and they seem comfortable, continue the conversation. If it goes too deep, recommend connecting later during the conference or maybe chatting on the Mattermost community server after the event.</li>\n<li><strong>No Hard Pitching:</strong> Most people understand what our goals are at an event. The chances of closing the deal, even at a large scale, enterprise event, are nearly nil. A hard press often disaffects potential clients. Especially with the tech-minded.</li>\n<li><strong>Be aware of cultural differences:</strong> Occasionally there are cultural norms that change the course of conversation. Some examples include the reserved nature of many Scandinavian cultures or the brash, \u201cwe know this\u201d nature of Americans. While no one expects you to obtain a minor in Cultural Anthropology or Sociology, be aware of certain norms from cultures outside your own.</li>\n<li><strong>Assume everyone is an expert:</strong> Regardless of any outward appearance, assume everyone we interact with has been working in their field and has top-level expertise. We do not assume anyone is junior or not tech-minded for any reason. They are approaching us with some level of interest. Let\u2019s work to keep that interest kindled.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Event Engaged Attendee</li>\n<li><strong>Virtual:</strong> Any attendee who attends a talk or visits the booth interactively. This can include volunteering their information directly or having it provided by the organizers post-event.</li>\n<li><strong>In-person:</strong> Any attendee who attends a talk, offers their information at a booth or other station, interacts with any Mattermost representative with intent on further examining Mattermost. Interactions to simply look at Mattermost or to discuss philosophies of Mattermost may notbe considered \"engaged\" - this can be left to the respresentatives discretion.</li>\n<li>Talk</li>\n<li>Any keynote, speech, presentation, demo, or workshop given at an external event (or at MatterCon).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Assets</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/10AZQP5QaUHOd-cuiogA08TD6Im0XvS1qpOBIDcnJScI/edit?usp=sharing\">Conference/Trip Report</a>: To be used after speaking at an event or participating as a sponsor or in a sales or marketing capacity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Process for inviting staff to events</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Allocate available passes to each department - e.g. 1 Eng, 1 Product, 1 Support, 2 Sales/CS, 1 Marketing. Allocation is typically based on</li>\n<li><strong>Goal of an event</strong> For example, if the main goal is to generate sales leads, we'd have a bigger sales/marketing presence. If the main goal is product or community awareness, then a bigger engineering/product presence.</li>\n<li><strong>Audience</strong> For example, if the audience is mostly users (devs, etc), then we tend to bring more community, product or engineering folks. Usually aligned with the goal of an event, but not always. An example is FOSDEM where we only bring the community team and engineers.</li>\n<li>Based on allocation, create a list of specific individuals we'd like to invite.</li>\n<li>Prioritize those who have expressed interested in attending events.</li>\n<li>Prioritize those who are geographically close (lower costs, less time and effort for folks to attend).</li>\n<li>Prioritize specific needs, e.g. for KubeCon, we have previously invited engineers who worked on our Kubernetes operator and Cloud platform, instead of other engineers. For security events it has been our security engineers, etc.</li>\n<li>Once we have an invite list:</li>\n<li>Reach out to their manager asking if they are okay for us to pull a headcount for the event.</li>\n<li>If either the MLT/manager or individual says no, ask who they'd recommend instead.</li>\n<li>Invite each person individually.</li>\n</ol>",

We typically use [V2MOMs](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-vpmom) as a structure for our yearly plans.\n\n## Quarterly Planning\n\nQuarterly planning involves the following:\n\n1. Research:\n   1. **Business goals** - Understand how the product \\(Core, Teams, Enterprise\\) can impact the Company VPMOM. Review company metrics. Identify areas we are doing well and areas we need to improve. \n   2. **Product telemetry** - Review product KPI dashboards. Identify areas we are doing well and areas we need to improve. \n   3. **Community feedback** - Overview of feedback captured in Uservoice, Jira, customer call notes, NPS surveys, app store reviews, forums etc.\n   4. **Customer requests** - CS and Sales each submit a prioritized list of asks for next quarter. A call is held so PMs can understand the requests and prioritization rationale. \n   5. **Competitive positioning** - SWOT analysis for Mattermost compared to competitors. Overview of competitor roadmaps, recent releases, and trends in the market. Recap of any news on players entering or leaving the market. Review with marketing, sales, and CS. \n   6. **Dev-driven initiatives** - Identify key upcoming dev-driven initiatives, and understand the goals behind them.\n2. Prioritization:\n   1. **Discuss product goals** - Reviewing the research, product working groups \\(Core, Teams, Enterprise\\) meet and propose any changes to key product goals to focus on. \n   2. **Backlog overview & SWAGs** - Based on research, PMs update list of items being considered for the roadmap \\(make sure to include dev-driven initiatives\\). PMs work with teams to SWAG items. \n   3. **Propose key themes** - Based on research, identify key themes that will have the highest impact on our goals.\n   4. **Map out strategic value** - Map out where themes or backlog items fit in a matrix \n      1. Value vs Cost \\(Effort/Risk/Complexity\\)\n      2. Urgency vs Importance\n   5. **Prioritized list** - Based on the above, stack rank the initiatives. \\(Using a prioritization framework such as RICE may be helpful here - if we switch to a new tool we can work on a custom framework\\). \n   6. **Determine mana budget** - Determine how many resources are available this quarter. If needed, map out which people will be needed for which projects. \n3. Release Plan:\n   1. **Goals** - Summarize goals\n   2. **Big rocks / Themes** - Highlight the key initiatives impacting those goals. Please include: \n      1. An overview of top initiatives that will be worked on\n      2. An overview of what is planned to ship in the quarter \\(identify which are \u201cmust haves\u201d and which have flexibility\\)\n   3. **Launches** - Identify at least one key marketing launch for the quarter. \n   4. **Reference** - \n      1. **Backlog Review** \n         1. **Request Review** - For the submitted list of asks from CSMs, SAs, and Support, highlight which were accepted, which were not, and why\n         2. **Prioritized List** - Share prioritized list, so people can see the backlog of items considered and discuss why the selected ones were prioritized over others\n      2. External Commitments - Track any concrete or estimated timelines we have shared externally\n4. Release Plan Reviews: \n   1. **1% - Align on Goals** \n      1. Working Group \n      2. Product & Engineering Leadership\n   2. **50% - Get Buy-in on Prioritization** \n      1. CSM/SA/Support \n      2. \\(Future\\) Customer Advisory Board \n      3. Product and Engineering Leadership \n   3. **99% - Finalize and publish** \n      1. Exec team - Product Leadership presents to MLT, and any feedback is brought back to the PM team. If needed, one more MLT call may be scheduled to finalize any decisions. \n\nThe above is typically conducted in the following timeline:\n\n* **Kick-off - 10 weeks before quarter start**\n  * Share timeline with PM team + Working Group \n  * _NOTE: This is 1 week after that month\u2019s MLT Monthly Strategic meeting, enabling product leadership to cascade priorities to the product team_\n* **1% draft \\(align on goals\\) - 8 weeks before quarter start**\n  * Working Group \n  * Dev Leads\n  * Product & Engineering Leadership \\(shared during OKR check-in\\)\n  * _NOTE: This is 1 week before that month\u2019s MLT Monthly Strategic meeting_\n* **50% draft \\(buy-in on prioritization\\) - 5-6 weeks before quarter start**\n  * CSM/SA/Support\n  * CAB \\(in future\\)\n  * Product and Engineering Leadership\n  * _NOTE: Timed before MLT Board meeting; Dev Leads draft OKRs around this time_\n* **99% draft \\(finalize\\) - 3-4 weeks before quarter start**\n  * Exec team\n  * _NOTE: Timed before MLT Offsite. Also enables PM + Dev Lead to start planning resources ahead of quarter start; Dev Leads finalize OKRs around this time_\n* **Live - 1 week before quarter start**\n  * Shared internally and externally as needed, e.g. COM\n\n## Monthly Release Plan Timeline\n\nMonthly release planning takes place via monthly 30-minute OKR meetings with Product and Engineering leadership to share progress on quarterly goals.\n\n1. First 20 mins\n   1. Entire team \\(Dev, Design, PM, QA\\) attends\n   2. Review Quarterly OKRs\n      1. Review updated progress percentages \n      2. Team shares any related technical designs, UX designs, or demos \n      3. Discuss any delays, blockers, or changes in priorities \n   3. Review Community Campaigns \n2. Last 10 min \n   1. Dev Lead and PM attend\n   2. Discuss future planning, and feedback for team\n\nMoreover, the following cross-department calls take place:\n\n* Monthly **product prioritization calls** to get alignment on direction of the product roadmap among Sales, Product and Engineering leadership team. One stakeholder from product, SA and CSM groups are present.\n* **Monthly release plan calls** led by product team, attended by CSO, support and SAs, to review what's planned for upcoming releases, and Q&A from CSO/support/SAs\n\n## **Product Roadmap Timeline**\n\nThe timeline below is for Jan/2020 - Sept/2020.\n\n**Legend:**\n\n* **Grey =** Holidays or weekends\n* **Orange =** Key dates where roadmap is likely discussed \\(either within MLT, across company or externally such as with board\\)\n* **Green =** Key MLT meetings where roadmap may be discussed\n* **Purple =** Key product roadmap planning dates\n\n_**\\(Calendars are provided as screenshots, until proper Markdown formatting for tables is found.

        "content": "# Secure Software Development at Mattermost\n\nThis document provides guidelines to secure software development at Mattermost. The document is at the moment a [50% draft](/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#drafts-at-1-50-99) and not conclusive.\n\n## Document scope\n\nThis document covers the secure software development practices on all source repositories used to create software products offered by Mattermost.\n\nThe product security team is overall in charge of secure software development practices by providing help and guidance and performing various verification activities, including code reviews and testing. Development teams are encouraged to adopt the secure software development practices described here. Third-party plugin developers are also welcome to use this document for guidance.\n\n## Recommended reading\n\n* [OSSF Scorecard Action Check Documentation](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md)\n* [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), a curated and updated list on most common security risks in web applications.\n* [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)\n* [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/)\n\n## Code reviews\n\n### Manual code reviews\n\nThe product security team performs reviews on new features and plugins when necessary. Here's some of the things included in the checks:\n\n* Manual diff review\n* Static application security testing (SAST) using multiple tools\n* Software composition analysis (SCA)\n* Dynamic application security testing (DAST)\n\nDetailed review checklists are documented in the [security team shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s3paBN6sfGRP-NHNuoekDHY_nrtRVagt), accessible to team members only.\n\n### Automated code reviews\n\nMattermost production repositories have automated code security analysis tools set up. If this is not the case for a specific repository, please reach out to the product security team for assistance.\n\nThe automated tools in each repository depend on the technologies used in the repository. In practice, we use [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) as a Github Action to automatically analyze all pull requests. Additionally, the use of the [OSSF Security Scorecards GitHub Action](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) is strongly encouraged. This document describes some of the best practices checked by the Scorecards action.\n\n## Dependency pinning\n\nDependency pinning hardens software development workflows against [software supply chain attacks](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/the-year-long-rash-of-supply-chain-attacks-against-open-source-is-getting-worse/). The specific threat being mitigated is upstream dependencies being taken over by attackers and replaced with malicious content. Attacks are more likely to be successful against projects that refer to their dependencies without explicitly specifying a computed hash value for the dependency: In case of a dependency takeover, pulling the _latest_ version triggers the attack. The likelihood of this risk materializing is low, but the impact can be bad.\n\nIn practice, defining build-time dependencies with an explicit hash is the preferred solution. When specifying hashes to existing dependencies that did not use hash-based references before, picking the hash of the currently used dependency is a good starting point as it is often not practical to do a full audit of all dependencies. Picking a hash and sticking to it doesn't ensure that the hash represents a safe version, but it does ensures that a possibly malicious later version is not introduced in the build process afterwards.\n\nMany dependency managers support automatic dependency pinning so that a developer doesn't need to explicitly find and set dependency hashes. For example both Go and npm do, as described below.\n\n### Npm dependencies\n\nWith npm, always use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` in build scripts and automated pipelines. This ensures that only packages matching the existing `package-lock.json` file are installed. See [the documentation on `npm ci`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-ci) for more details.\n\nWhen adding new dependencies, prefer [exact versions](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install#save-exact) over the default semver range.\n\n### Docker\n\nDocker image dependencies exist in Dockerfiles and elsewhere, such as in CircleCI config files. The [Dockpin](https://github.com/Jille/dockpin) tool can be used to pin Docker base images to their currently latest versions. To pin a dockerfile, run `dockpin docker pin -f Dockerfile`. To pin Docker base image dependencies elsewhere, run `dockpin docker resolve [base-image]`; for example `dockpin docker resolve ubuntu@20.04`.\n\nHere's a handy script to do this on CircleCI yaml files, replacing the image reference with one with a hash, and additionally commenting with the timestamp the hash was obtained:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\nymlfile=$1\n\nif [ -z \"$1\" ] ; then\n    echo usage: $0 circleci-config-ymlfile\n    echo example: $0 ./.circleci/config.yml\n    exit 0\nfi\n\nfor x in `grep -A1 docker $1|grep -- '- image:'|sed 's/.*image:\\ \\(.*\\)/\\1/g'|sed \"s/'//g\"|sort|uniq`;do\n    hashed=`dockpin docker resolve $x`\n    echo base $x hashed $hashed\n    sed -i \"s~$x~$hashed\\ #\\ $x,\\ `date`~g\" $ymlfile\ndone\n```\n\n### Go\n\nWhen adding a Go dependency using `go get`, the dependency can be installed specifying either a specific version (`go get example.com/theirmodule@v1.3.4`), the latest available version (`go get example.com/theirmodule@latest`), or a commit hash (`go get example.com/theirmodule@4cf76c2`) or branchname (`@branchname`). In all cases, the installed dependencies are added to the automatically generated `go.mod` file and the content hashes of the dependencies are written to the `go.sum` file. Make sure to commit both the `go.mod` and the `go.sum` file to your repository. This ensures that subsequent builds download exactly the same dependencies.\n\n### Github Actions\n\nGitHub Actions are specified in `.yml` files in the `.github/workflows` directory inside a GitHub repository. Check out [this nice tool](https://app.stepsecurity.io/) by [Stepsecurity](https://www.stepsecurity.io/) that can harden the workflow spec. Check at least the \"Restrict permissions...\" and \"Pin actions...\" boxes, then paste in the workflow `.yml` file and click \"Secure workflow\". Review the changes and paste the result back into your workflow `.yml` file.\n\n## A few other things\n\n(most from the [Scorecard checks](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard#scorecard-checks) -- consult with product security team)\n\n* Check that the git repository doesn't contain any secrets anywhere in its history\n* Make sure the `SECURITY.md` file exists and describes the security policy\n* [Branch protection policy](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches)\n* Set up SAST (static analysis) -- mostly we use [CodeQL](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/enabling-code-scanning-for-a-repository#enabling-code-scanning-using-actions)",

        "title": "Mobile Feature Guidelines",
        "content": "# Mobile Feature Guidelines\n\nNew product features should consider the mobile client at the same level of importance as the web app client. For new features implemented on the server or web app, please consider the mobile client through these lenses:\n\n## Are mobile app code changes needed?\n\nA good rule of thumb is that if there are web app repo code changes \\(outside of the System Console UI\\), mobile code changes are needed to support the feature.\n\nWhile not every web app feature needs parity with mobile, this is a discussion to have with the Product Managers and UX team, and a decision to be made in the requirements gathering phase of feature design.\n\n* If a feature requires mobile code changes, the Mobile team PM \\(Eric Sethna\\) should be made aware of the feature before it\u2019s committed to the feature team's quarterly roadmap. Please involve the Mobile team PM in roadmap planning and quarterly OKR planning discussions. The same applies even if the feature team will be doing the mobile implementation themselves, given that the Mobile team will be involved in code reviews, testing, and should provide guidance on the feature implementation.\n* During design and spec development of any feature that will involve mobile code changes, please involve the Mobile PM \\(Eric Sethna\\) and Mobile dev lead \\(Elias Nahum\\) at all stakeholder checkpoints including requirements gathering, design option exploration, and final design review.\n* Set deliverables taking into account the limitation that a team may not have enough skills to develop features for mobile. Consider the impact if the feature is left out from mobile, document the reasons, and set goals to cover the mobile space. The feature should be [released as beta or experimental](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/product-management-team-handbook#can-we-take-this-feature-out-of-beta) and any documentation should clearly communicate the impact of not having mobile support as well as when mobile support is expected.\n* If a feature is related to authentication, such as Single Sign-On \\(SSO\\), plan to release the feature on Mobile Apps prior to Cloud to avoid users from being blocked from using the Mobile Apps.\n\n## Backward compatibility\n\n* Mobile releases must be backward compatible with at least all server versions back to the [oldest supported ESR](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/extended-support-release.html). An important question to ask during design is: _What is the expected behavior on a new server with an old app, or a new app with an old server?_\n\nHere's an example:\n\n* **New mobile app with an old server:** If the server is running older code and does not support the new feature, we can\u2019t allow users to access the feature from a new mobile app.\n  * Example: Hide the \u201cMark as Unread\u201d option if the server is older than v5.18.\n    * [Use the isMinimumServerVersion helper function](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/screens/post_options/index.js#L49)\n* **New server with an old mobile app:** Users will not be able access the new features from their mobile device since it\u2019s running older code, but the new server code should not cause regressions to a user's experience on an older mobile app.\n  * Example: Users cannot see the \u201cMark as Unread\u201d option in an older mobile app that does not contain that code, but marking a channel unread on a webapp running v5.20 or later should still mark the channel as unread on mobile, and not cause any mobile app regressions for a user running an old app.\n\nIdeally any new features should be tested on all server versions back to the [oldest supported ESR](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/extended-support-release.html?highlight=esr). However, since testing mana is limited, feel free to work with your QA representative to determine the most effective testing approach based on the risks of your feature. At a minimum, new mobile app features should be tested on all supported server ESRs and the latest three server versions.\n\nFor new features, consider a `minserverversion` check that only executes the code if the server connected to the app is newer than xyz. [See example to disable or not the position field when editing the profile](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/ee4b85edcfee8316db08c31ec5b2a26afb343bd3/app/screens/edit_profile/index.js#L29).\n\nBonus: Legacy servers \\(i.e. &lt; v5.0\\) don't have post metadata, don't rely on it.\n\n## Variable network conditions\n\n* API requests will fail on mobile because network conditions are much more variable than on desktop. As such defaults need to be carefully chosen to avoid failing requests breaking or blocking core user functionality. As an example, if the default for a channel is set to be read-only until a permission API request grants the user permissions, this is likely to result in a poor user experience in bad networks.\n\nWhen in doubt, [the default if an API request fails should not change existing behavior, or a failed API request should either do nothing or notify the user somehow](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/mm-redux/actions/preferences.ts#L18).\n\n* [Retries should be added to important API requests](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/actions/views/channel.js#L607).\n\n## Client performance impact\n\n* Mobile devices vary significantly in their computing capabilities, as such performance should be top of mind when developing mobile features.\n* Minimize requests where possible, make requests in parallel if possible, batch dispatches wherever possible.\n\n  [https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/actions/views/user.js\\#L79](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/actions/views/user.js#L79)\n\n* Do NOT track requests. Examples:\n  * Here we are fetching the needed data in sequence but holding dispatching any action, and then once we have all the required data we dispatch an action batch. With this we ensure that the redux store is being updated only once and that every `mapStateToProps` of mounted connected components runs once instead of multiple times, this will then reduce computation time: [https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/actions/views/user.js\\#L51](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/actions/views/user.js#L51).\n  * Here we are fetching data from the server in sequential order and then in parallel, as we need data from one request and then all others are not dependent on each other. The use of `Promise.all` will help wait on all responses but take into consideration if one of them fails, everything will fail \\(do add retries if needed\\). In the end we batch the actions as we do in the example above: [https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/actions/views/user.js\\#L79](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/actions/views/user.js#L79).\n  * Don\u2019t do this: Here we are using a bind function or an action created that is dispatching at least two actions in total, one for tracking the start of the request and then if the requests succeeded or failed.

For new features implemented on the server or web app, please consider the mobile client through these lenses:</p>\n<h2>Are mobile app code changes needed?</h2>\n<p>A good rule of thumb is that if there are web app repo code changes (outside of the System Console UI), mobile code changes are needed to support the feature.</p>\n<p>While not every web app feature needs parity with mobile, this is a discussion to have with the Product Managers and UX team, and a decision to be made in the requirements gathering phase of feature design.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a feature requires mobile code changes, the Mobile team PM (Eric Sethna) should be made aware of the feature before it\u2019s committed to the feature team's quarterly roadmap. Please involve the Mobile team PM in roadmap planning and quarterly OKR planning discussions. The same applies even if the feature team will be doing the mobile implementation themselves, given that the Mobile team will be involved in code reviews, testing, and should provide guidance on the feature implementation.</li>\n<li>During design and spec development of any feature that will involve mobile code changes, please involve the Mobile PM (Eric Sethna) and Mobile dev lead (Elias Nahum) at all stakeholder checkpoints including requirements gathering, design option exploration, and final design review.</li>\n<li>Set deliverables taking into account the limitation that a team may not have enough skills to develop features for mobile. Consider the impact if the feature is left out from mobile, document the reasons, and set goals to cover the mobile space. The feature should be <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/product-management-team-handbook#can-we-take-this-feature-out-of-beta\">released as beta or experimental</a> and any documentation should clearly communicate the impact of not having mobile support as well as when mobile support is expected.</li>\n<li>If a feature is related to authentication, such as Single Sign-On (SSO), plan to release the feature on Mobile Apps prior to Cloud to avoid users from being blocked from using the Mobile Apps.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Backward compatibility</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Mobile releases must be backward compatible with at least all server versions back to the <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/extended-support-release.html\">oldest supported ESR</a>. An important question to ask during design is: <em>What is the expected behavior on a new server with an old app, or a new app with an old server?</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's an example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New mobile app with an old server:</strong> If the server is running older code and does not support the new feature, we can\u2019t allow users to access the feature from a new mobile app.</li>\n<li>Example: Hide the \u201cMark as Unread\u201d option if the server is older than v5.18.<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/screens/post_options/index.js#L49\">Use the isMinimumServerVersion helper function</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>New server with an old mobile app:</strong> Users will not be able access the new features from their mobile device since it\u2019s running older code, but the new server code should not cause regressions to a user's experience on an older mobile app.</li>\n<li>Example: Users cannot see the \u201cMark as Unread\u201d option in an older mobile app that does not contain that code, but marking a channel unread on a webapp running v5.20 or later should still mark the channel as unread on mobile, and not cause any mobile app regressions for a user running an old app.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ideally any new features should be tested on all server versions back to the <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/extended-support-release.html?highlight=esr\">oldest supported ESR</a>. However, since testing mana is limited, feel free to work with your QA representative to determine the most effective testing approach based on the risks of your feature. At a minimum, new mobile app features should be tested on all supported server ESRs and the latest three server versions.</p>\n<p>For new features, consider a <code>minserverversion</code> check that only executes the code if the server connected to the app is newer than xyz. <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/ee4b85edcfee8316db08c31ec5b2a26afb343bd3/app/screens/edit_profile/index.js#L29\">See example to disable or not the position field when editing the profile</a>.</p>\n<p>Bonus: Legacy servers (i.e. &lt; v5.0) don't have post metadata, don't rely on it.</p>\n<h2>Variable network conditions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>API requests will fail on mobile because network conditions are much more variable than on desktop. As such defaults need to be carefully chosen to avoid failing requests breaking or blocking core user functionality. As an example, if the default for a channel is set to be read-only until a permission API request grants the user permissions, this is likely to result in a poor user experience in bad networks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When in doubt, <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/mm-redux/actions/preferences.ts#L18\">the default if an API request fails should not change existing behavior, or a failed API request should either do nothing or notify the user somehow</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/actions/views/channel.js#L607\">Retries should be added to important API requests</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Client performance impact</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Mobile devices vary significantly in their computing capabilities, as such performance should be top of mind when developing mobile features.</li>\n<li>Minimize requests where possible, make requests in parallel if possible, batch dispatches wherever possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/actions/views/user.js#L79\">https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/actions/views/user.js#L79</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do NOT track requests. Examples:</li>\n<li>Here we are fetching the needed data in sequence but holding dispatching any action, and then once we have all the required data we dispatch an action batch. With this we ensure that the redux store is being updated only once and that every <code>mapStateToProps</code> of mounted connected components runs once instead of multiple times, this will then reduce computation time: <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/actions/views/user.js#L51\">https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/actions/views/user.js#L51</a>.</li>\n<li>Here we are fetching data from the server in sequential order and then in parallel, as we need data from one request and then all others are not dependent on each other. The use of <code>Promise.all</code> will help wait on all responses but take into consideration if one of them fails, everything will fail (do add retries if needed). In the end we batch the actions as we do in the example above: <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/actions/views/user.js#L79\">https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/actions/views/user.js#L79</a>.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t do this: Here we are using a bind function or an action created that is dispatching at least two actions in total, one for tracking the start of the request and then if the requests succeeded or failed. That means that calling that function will update the store twice instead of once:<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/mm-redux/actions/teams.ts#L67\">https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/mm-redux/actions/teams.ts#L67</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/mm-redux/actions/teams.ts#L103\">https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/app/mm-redux/actions/teams.ts#L103</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",

The guiding principle is [no surprises](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/manifesto.html#no-surprises) with guaranteed long-term stability, where admins or users should never run into anything unexpected while using Mattermost.\n\n### Definition of a deprecated feature\n\nA deprecated feature is considered to be one that breaks backwards compatibility with previous versions.\n\nExamples include:\n\n1\\) Removing an API endpoint, or one of its parameters.\n\n* APIv3 endpoints on January 16, 2018.\n* \u201cpermanent\u201d parameter of the DELETE /teams/{team\\_id} APIv4 endpoint in Mattermost v5.0.0.\n\n2\\) Removing a config.json setting\n\n* System Console settings in **Files > Images** in Mattermost v4.0.0.\n\n3\\) Removing an end user setting or functionality.\n\n* Font setting in **Account Settings > Display** in Mattermost v4.0.0.\n\n### Notice\n\nWhen the decision to deprecate a feature or function is made, the product manager responsible for the feature carries out the following actions:\n\n1. Adds the scheduled deprecation to the [deprecated features page](https://docs.mattermost.com/deploy/deprecated-features.html) with a note of what it's been replaced with.\n2. Prepares a forum post describing the reasons for deprecating the feature, providing an opportunity for the community to share feedback. See a [sample forum post](https://forum.mattermost.com/t/switching-teammate-name-display-to-a-system-console-setting/3366).\n3. Creates a JIRA ticket for removing the feature, including a prefix \u201cDeprecation:\u201d and a fix version matching the removal target date.\n\nMoreover, the acting release manager takes the following actions:\n\n1. [20 working days before each release](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/release-process/feature-release#c-t-minus-20-working-days-feature-complete), adds a list of deprecated features to the compatibility section of the [changelog](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/changelog.html) and [important upgrade notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html). The changelog should include deprecations scheduled for upcoming releases.\n2. [20 working days before each release](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/release-process/feature-release#c-t-minus-20-working-days-feature-complete), sends the list of deprecated features to the marketing manager, who includes this information in the release announcement.\n3. [2 working days before each release](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/release-process/feature-release#k-t-minus-2-working-days-release-build-cut), ensures the [deprecated features page](https://docs.mattermost.com/install/deprecated-features/) is up to date.\n\n## Removal target date\n\nThe removal target date should always be the date of the next major release, such as v4.0.0. If the date is not known, you can reference the next major version rather than the actual release date.\n\nHowever, there should always be at least two months from the time the deprecation is announced to its removal. This number is chosen to match our security backport release policy.\n\nSee the table below for examples:\n\n| Deprecation Announced | Final Minor Release | Removal Target Date |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 3.9.0 | 3.10.0 | 4.0.0 |\n| 3.10.0 | 3.10.0 | 5.0.0 |\n\nExceptions for the removal target date may be made if it impacts security or the performance of Mattermost. In such cases, the target date for removing the feature may be made sooner.\n\nOn the other hand, if removing a feature is deemed significant, such as the removal of APIv3 endpoints, the target date for removing the feature may be extended to a later release.\n",

These are the only bugs that can be committed after the T-10 Code Freeze deadline.\n  * S2 - `Functionality loss or glaring UI regressions` - Most users\u2019 functionality affected (e.g. cannot favorite a channel) or includes functional and UI regressions that affect functionality. In addition to S1 bugs, these are the only bugs that can be committed after Code Complete deadline until T-10 Code Freeze.\n  * S3 - `Minor issues or cosmetic UI regressions` - Half or less than half of users\u2019 functionality affected. Cosmetic UI issues or regression (e.g. cannot create custom emoji if System Admin).\n\n## Assigning severity levels\n\nSeverity levels on bug tickets should be filled in by the ticket reporter by using the **Severity** field.\n\nBug tickets are sometimes assessed on a case-by-case basis and further considerations may be applied, such as whether the bug is a recent regression or not, how risky the bug fix is, or whether it\u2019s more effective to revert code that initially caused the bug.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Why are we doing this?**\n\n* This will help with prioritizing release bug fixes, and composing release metrics.

For example, a fix for an issue where [Mattermost server crashed when running a compliance export](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-23157) was fixed for v5.21.0 at T-3 because it was an urgent, high severity customer bug.\n\n",

These principles align the R&D team on the approach to product development and provide insight to our customers why we act the way we do.\n\n## Product Direction not Roadmap\n\nWe are **Customer Obsessed**. Working in an agile development process, we think of roadmapping and product development as living; subject to changes as our communities and customer needs change. The further out we commit, the harder it is for us to adapt to our customers\u2019 needs. We use customer feedback to guide our product direction.\n\n## Collaborative Product Design\n\nWe **Earn Trust**. We welcome input from all members of the core staff and community. We appreciate input on the technical solution, user interface design, overall user experience and functional behavior of the product. This helps us uncover blind spots and promotes input and perspective of our customers.\n\n## MVP and Iteration\n\nWe are **Self-Aware** and work on **High Impact** changes. We use data in our decision-making processes. By developing an MVP \\(minimum viable product\\) of a solution, we can gather more data to inform our future work; thereby allowing us to create solutions for real pains. A MVP may include providing a prototype or a partial solution so we can collect feedback in the most realistic scenarios. We try to ship the smallest thing as quickly as possible and learn from it, so we make sure what we are building is going to create the value expected by our customers.\n\n## Quality is a first class citizen\n\nWe **Insist on High Standards** and have **Ownership** of the work we do.. This means we keep a high quality bar for our product. Each release we follow a thorough testing process that ensures each feature meets our [design principles](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/fx-guidelines.html), is tested for happy path and edge cases and meets security best practices. If a new feature does not meet our quality bar, we will push it into a later release instead of risking creating issues and frustration for our customers. If we find out that there is an issue in a version of released software, we prioritize fixing it.

        "content": "# Release Planning Process\n\nThere are three distinctive characteristics that influence our release planning process:\n\n1. Agile development cycle\n2. Time-based releases\n3. Release planning cadence\n\n## Agile development cycle\n\nThe waterfall model follows a linear approach to software development where each phase in the process only begins after the previous phase is complete. The intent of this approach is to deliver a feature to customers once all the agreed upon requirements are completed.\n\nAn agile methodology is a more iterative approach. Components of the work is shared with customers as they are completed for feedback and validation - this may include Beta releases, prototypes or even wireframes during the design stage. The intent is that customers have more opportunities to influence decisions and enables development teams to change direction faster if needed.\n\nMattermost uses the agile methodology for development because it supports iteration and allows the product team to get closer to our customers and users. This is also the model that development teams have been adopting in recent years.\n\nThis means our release planning process is also agile. We continuously iterate our priorities based on new feedback and painpoints we receive, and treat our release plan as a continuously evolving, living document. Therefore, typically we lock the release plan for a quarter. The next quarter\u2019s work is usually queued, but there is some flexibility to changes prior to beginning development. Work planned for more than two quarters in the future is very flexible to changes and reprioritization.\n\n## Time-based releases\n\nIn a feature-based release cycle, you release when a given set of features is implemented. Thus, there is no release date set until the work is complete.\n\nIn a time-based release cycle, you release at a predetermined date with whatever features are ready at the time. As a result, some features may be pushed to a following release, but the release date itself does not change.\n\nMattermost uses time-based releases for the following reasons:\n\n* **Trust:** Having a predetermined release date increases predictability as it enables organizations to plan their own upgrade cycle.\n* **Iteration:** Having a set release cadence enables us to release new features and bug fixes early and often; in a feature-based release cycle, a release may get delayed by days or even weeks if surprises arise during the release cycle.\n* **Community:** A time-based release cycle is preferred among developer communities, especially in open source. Contributors are aware of the release schedule and often aim to complete development by a specified date so that the feature makes it into a release. However, if those dates are missed, we can simply deliver the community-built feature on the next release. Doing feature-based releases with the community is risky, since there is generally less influence on when exactly the work is completed.\n\nYou can find step-by-step details of the release planning process and timelines at [https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/release-process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/release-process).\n\n## Release planning cadence\n\nAt Mattermost, our planning cadence consists of:\n\n* **Yearly:** Company fiscal year and long term product strategy planning\n* **Quarterly:** Release Plan and Quarterly OKR planning\n* **Monthly:** Check in on OKR status\n\nSince we follow an agile development style, our release plan is also agile. We plan releases quarterly, following the process outlined below.\n\nBefore each quarter begins, we lock on plans for:\n\n* **What's Launching:** Key initiatives we plan to work with Marketing on launching this quarter.\n* **What's In Progress:** Key initiatives we will start working on this quarter, but may not ship until a future quarter.\n\nWe also update the backlog to show which items we are considering for 6 to 12 months out, but this list is flexible and gets updated each quarter based on any changes to company strategy, product goals, community needs, and market conditions.\n\n",

Customer-facing teams can add notes to Productboard based on [this process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/how-to-guides-for-product/how-to-use-productboard#productboard-insights-also-called-notes).\n\n[Uservoice](https://mattermost.uservoice.com/forums/306457-general) is used for our community to submit a request or upvote existing requests.\n\nThe Product Management team uses the information from both our customers and community to help prioritize features for the roadmap.\n\n## Where to share feedback?\n\nThe Mattermost Product team uses information from our customers and the open-source community to guide feature roadmap.\n\nWe use two forums to connect with the user community - [Customer ProductBoard](https://portal.productboard.com/mattermost/33-what-matters-to-you/) and [Community Feature Proposal Forum](https://mattermost.uservoice.com/forums/306457-general). \n\n### Customer ProductBoard\n\nCustomer ProductBoard is a place for paying customers to connect directly with the product team on improvements most important to our ideal customer profile (ICP):\nhttps://portal.productboard.com/mattermost/33-what-matters-to-you/tabs/120-community-requested-features\n\nIn this portal, customers can share how important an improvement is, share their use cases relevant to those improvements, and submit new ideas directly to the product team.\n\nProduct Managers review the feedback weekly to guide product direction and feature roadmap development.\n\n### Community Feature Proposal Forum\n\nCommunity Feature Proposal Forum is a place for users in our free deployments to propose new feature ideas:\nhttps://mattermost.uservoice.com/forums/306457-general\n\nIn this forum, community members can propose new features, share ideas for new improvements, and connect with other members in refining their proposed features.\n\nCommunity Manager reviews the feedback weekly to hear what matters to the most engaged users in free deployments. Key trends are also shared with the Product team.\n\n## Filing great feature requests\n\nWhen filing a feature request, the most important thing to do is capture the \"why\" behind it. A great way to do this is by writing requests in the form of an \"Experience Report\". As described in the [golang wiki](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/ExperienceReports):\n\n**\"The best experience reports tell: \\(1\\) what you wanted to do, \\(2\\) what you actually did, and \\(3\\) why that wasn\u2019t great, illustrating those by real concrete examples.\"**\n\nWriting in this format ensures the focus is on pain points, rather than solutions. This allows us to better define the root of the problem, which in turn makes it easier to come up with creative solutions to fix it.\n\nIf you're filing a feature request on behalf of a customer, make sure to also include:\n\n* Who requested the feature.\n* How important it is to them \\(ideally, based on stack rank against their other requests\\).\n* Links to any relevant conversations, Zendesk tickets, etc.\n\n## Escalating a feature request\n\nGenerally speaking, feature requests are prioritized through our normal roadmap process. The roadmap provides an idea of where the feature falls on our prioritization list, but is not a committed release date.\n\nIf a deal is dependent on committing to a concrete timeline for a feature, the Sales team can escalate the request by sharing:\n\n* What is the request?\n* What is the timeline ask from the customer?\n* Are there other \u201cmust have\u201d features blocking the deal? If so, please provide a full list.\n* If we build this feature, is the customer committed to closing the deal? If so, how big is the deal?\n* Did the customer offer NRE dollars to accelerate the feature?\n\nThe Product Management team will then evaluate the ask, and determine if we can commit to a timeline or if the feature does not fit on our roadmap.\n\nPlease be aware that committing to a concrete timeline for a deal is the exception not the norm, as it can have a negative impact on delivering other features that the rest of our user base is expecting.\n\n",

        "content": "# Roadmap Views\n\nMattermost has three different roadmap views: Public Product Direction, Internal Roadmap, and a Release Plan. Each has a specific target audience and framed in different ways:\n\n## Public Product Direction\n\nThis view is external-facing, shared publicly with our users, community and customers. This is currently available on our website \\([https://mattermost.com/direction/](https://mattermost.com/direction/)\\).\n\nThe primary intent is to share the vision and direction of the product with no committed dates. We use it to highlight the benefits of what we\u2019re building, so it\u2019s easy for people to picture how what we\u2019re building is going to make their Mattermost experience the best it can be. For an example of similar public product direction sites, see [https://about.gitlab.com/direction/](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/).\n\nIn addition to communicating the direction, we also include features framed in terms of estimated timelines on our [productboard portal](https://portal.productboard.com/mattermost/19-combined-highlighted-features)\n\n\n* **3+ Months:** This tab includes projects that are in progress now. We\u2019re happy to get on calls to share updates and gather feedback on specs, designs, and prototypes.\n* **6+ Months:** This stage covers projects coming up soon, after some of the \u201cNow\u201d work is completed. If an item is in this category, we\u2019re happy to have conversations validating requirements and use cases.\n* **Future Consideration:** This stage includes features we\u2019re considering for later. We\u2019re happy to have conceptual conversations on these items, to see which problems resonate the most. We add and remove things from this category as we learn from those conversations.\n\n\n## Internal Roadmap\n\nThis view is internal facing, shared cross-functionally across Mattermost staff, to let people see how our product efforts tie back to the higher level company goals and strategy. Items on the roadmap are related back to objectives, and the objectives tie back to our [Company Fiscal Year plan](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/mlt-cadence#fiscal-year-planning), so it\u2019s easy to see how everything fits together.\n\nKey distinction from the Public Product Direction is that this view is framed in terms of business goals \\(such as increasing NPS, ARR, retention\\) rather than benefits. Moreover, this view may include business initiatives such as the customer portal, technical, or telemetry efforts that are not outwardly beneficial to our customers.\n\n\n## Release Plan\n\nWe also create a release plan based on the internal roadmap. The purpose of the release plan is to enable project management for development teams. All dates in our release plan are target dates not commitments, and items are often moved, added, and removed from the list.\n\nThis view is internal facing, month-by-month release plan of new features. \n\nCurrently, the Release Plan can be found in [productboard](https://mattermost.productboard.com/roadmap/2855466-features-by-release), and is updated weekly by the Product Management team.\n\n[Learn more about release plans](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/tree/c36385e5895aa33eed32d17b0c64a2de922aef1a/operations/research-and-development/product/product-planning/operations/research-and-development/product/product-planning/release-plan/README.md).\n\n",

If you have write access to the repo, you can create a branch off master and work on that.\n\nOnce complete, submit your Pull Request \\(PR\\). Ensure that you assign appropriate approvers and labels - if you've forked the repo or don't have the correct repo permissions you may not be able to do this, so you can skip this step. Read more about the review process [here](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/code-review) - it applies to various types of contributions including documentation.\n\n### Submitting feature documentation\n\nFeature documentation is a joint effort between Product Managers and Technical Writers. In the same way that we want to empower everyone to contribute to our documentation, Product Managers are encouraged to write MVP documentation for their product/feature.\n\n**Note:** Due to the cadence of the release cycle, feature documentation needs to be complete and submitted as [per the release process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/release-process/feature-release#e-t-minus-15-working-days-judgment-day) to allow sufficient time for review and to ensure it's included in the release documentation update.\n\nThe supplied content can be provided informally, in bullet points, or rough notes in a Google Doc/Jira issue/on the PR itself. Refinements are made collaboratively.\n\n#### Feature documentation MVP (PMs)\n\nThis is a guideline of what MVP feature documentation can include. Requirements vary based on the scope of the change, so not everything will always be needed:\n\n* A link to the feature/product's tech spec.\n* Links to any relevant Jira/GitHub issues.\n* A description of the product/feature/update which forms the basis of the documentation.\n* Steps for any processes or procedures (configuration of a feature, troubleshooting, etc).\n* Any FAQs or troubleshooting questions if relevant.\n* Configuration settings and examples for the ``config.json`` file if relevant.\n* (If possible) Suggestions of where in the docs the content should go.\n\nWhen the content has been refined and approved in draft format:\n\n* The Product Manager/Technical Writer creates a branch off the relevant documentation release branch.\n* The documentation is updated with the approved content in that branch.\n * If there are multiple pages to update for a specific feature/change please keep them all in the same branch for ease of management.\n* The PR is submitted and relevant reviewers added, including an editor (not the Technical Writer who wrote the docs), for final review.\n * Include the link to the server/webapp repo issue in your PR for reference purposes.\n* Once all reviews are complete, the PR is marked as **Reviews Complete** and merged into the documentation release branch by @amyblais.\n\nYou can read more about the review process [here](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/code-review).\n\n### Submitting documentation with your PR\n\nWe want to empower everyone to contribute to our documentation, and be comfortable submitting documentation for contributions. As such, we don't expect every contribution to adhere to our style guide when first submitted.\n\nDuring the review process the editorial team also provides feedback on style elements to bring the submission in line with the [Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/core.html#documentation-style-guide).\n\nHere are some guidelines:\n\n* When submitting a PR, please include updated documentation if applicable.\n* The documentation update can be in the form of a bullet list or an outline.\n* Label the PR as **Docs Needed**/**Editor Review** and tag @justinegeffen or @carriewarnermm.\n* The documentation you've submitted will be reviewed.\n* At times, the editors may make and commit stylistic changes \\(such as punctuation\\) but any content changes will be added as a suggestion for the submitter's consideration.\n* Once the PR is approved, it will be merged, and the documentation will be updated.\n\nYou can read more about the review process [here](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/code-review).\n\n**Note:** This process does not apply to the [API Documentation requirements](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-api-reference) as it is updated automatically and isn't part of the documentation process.\n\n### Adding reviewers to PRs\n\nMattermost documentation covers a number of different topics. For documentation, the following reviewers are recommended:\n\n**Editor Review**\n\n* Amy Blais \\(@amyblais\\)\n* Carrie Warner \\(@cwarnermm\\)\n* Justine Geffen \\(@justinegeffen\\)\n\n**Product Manager Review**\n\n* Admin Guide - Enterprise: Katie Wiersgalla \\(@wiersgallak\\)\n* Admin Guide - Security: Katie Wiersgalla \\(@wiersgallak\\)\n* Admin Guide - Cloud: Katie Wiersgalla \\(@wiersgallak\\)\n* Admin Guide - Licensing: Jason Blais(\\@jasonblais\\)\n* End User Guide - Mobile and desktop app: Eric Sethna \\(@esethna\\)\n* Apps and Marketplace: Aaron Rothschild \\(@aaronrothschild\\)\n* Incident Collaboration: Ian Tao \\(@itao\\)\n* Handbook and Process; Community: Jason Blais \\(@jasonblais\\)\n\n**Dev Review**\n\nIf your change requires dev review add the developer/s you've been working with as the reviewer/s. If you're unsure who to add as a dev reviewer you can select one of the team leads below:\n\n* Core Enterprise Features: Scott Bishel \\(@sbishel\\)\n* Core Features: Scott Bishel \\(@sbishel\\)\n* Integrations: Catalin Tomei \\(@catalintomai\\)\n* Workflows \\(Incident Collaboration\\): Jesse Hallam \\(@lieut-data\\)\n* Growth: Maria Nu\u00f1ez \\(@marianunez)\n* SRE: Joram Wilander \\(@jwilander\\) (\\interm\\)\n* Cloud Platform: Joram Wilander \\(@jwilander\\)\n* Mobile: Elias Nahum \\(@enahum\\)\n* Web App and Desktop App: Dean Whillier \\(@deanwhillier\\)\n* Server/infra: Joram Wilander \\(@jwilander\\)\n* Cloud: Joram Wilander \\(@jwilander\\)\n* Security: Daniel Schalla \\(@dschalla\\)\n* QA: Linda Mitchell \\(@lindalumitchell)\n* Handbook and Process: Jason Blais \\(@jasonblais\\)\n\nThe full list of R&D teams is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lH8QIjQGEoGospDUdVs_LQ_i2b82I1ce6W7z18vhPTQ/edit#gid=0).\n\n### Requesting Documentation via Doc Up\n\nRequests for documentation can be made within [community.mattermost.com](https://community.mattermost.com), using the Doc Up plugin embedded in the post menu.\n\n![Access the Doc Up plugin by hovering over a message and clicking the &quot;...&quot; menu.](../../../.gitbook/assets/doc-up-plugin.png)\n\nWhen you select Doc Up and choose **Admin** as the issue type, an issue is generated in the GitHub docs repo, and added to the issues list. An update is listed in the Documentation channel, with the issue link.\n\nYou can also select **Developer** or **Company Handbook** to direct the Doc Up request to the appropriate repo.\n\nAs the issues are open to the community, the more information provided in the issue the better.\n\nReview the issue in the [docs repo](https://github.com/mattermost/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue), [developer documentation repo](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-developer-documentation/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue), or [handbook repo](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) and add any links to appropriate documentation and/or Jira tickets. This ensures that the assignee is able to take on and complete the work within the turnaround times.\n\n**Turnaround time**\n\nWhen the issue has been created, please follow these guidelines to assign [labels](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/labels). This ensures that the issues are prioritized appropriately.\n\nThere are a number of variables at play, such as review process, current workload, and type of work required which makes it difficult to provide a hard and fast time-frame for completion. Large projects might be moved to Jira if required.\n\n**Assignees**\n\nDocumentation does not have to be written by the Technical Writer/s. You can raise an issue, complete the requirement, and submit a Pull Request.\n\n**Community involvement**\n\nWe really want the community to own the docs as much as possible. In light of this, please mark your issue as **Help Wanted** so that community members are able to identify work that they\u2019re able to assist with. If your documentation request/issue applies to a repository other than *mattermost/docs*, you can use the **Docs Needed** and **Editor Review** labels and/or ping @justinegeffen or @cwarnermm.\n\n### i18n contributions\n\n**Note: This process is a 1% draft.***\n\nOur User's Guide and Administrator's Guide are available for translation contributions. Join the [i18n channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/localization) on our Community server and connect with our translation community members. The documentation translation process is still being defined.\n\nCurrently, submitting a translation PR follows the same writing and editing process as other PRs. However, there are additional considerations to bear in mind when submitting your PR as these assist with the approval and merge process:\n\n1. Do you have an active test instance running with the integrations guide translated so we can validate the rendering and formatting?\n2. If the content you're translating includes screenshots should we keep the original English versions of the screenshots, or consider translated versions of them too?\n3. If the intention is to translate the screenshots, is there a proposed process for keeping them up to date?\n4. Have at least one member of UX team and one member of Apps PM team review the user experience in choosing different languages.\n5. To maintain high standards for translated documentation, set up a process to notify translators when something is changed in the English-version of the docs, and expectation on correcting translations for new releases.\n6. Decide if we want to indicate translations level - e.g. \u201cAlpha\u201d or \u201cBeta\u201d for translations that are in progress.\n7. Test you can successfully rate a translated docs page by selecting a rating emoji. Ping @justine.geffen for validation of this.\n\n## General contribution workflow\n\n### Jira Tickets\n\nThe [Technical Writing Jira board](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=80) is a snapshot of the current Technical Writing workload. \n\nIf you have a feature, UI copy, or general documentation requirement, please create a ticket and include the following fields:\n\n* Label: Documentation\n* Team: Tech Writing\n* Assign the ticket to the relevant writer.\n* Select a sprint.\n* Add the \"docs/needed\" label so the issue shows up on our board.\n\nFor best results, please include as much content, context, and detail as possible.\n\nIf the Jira ticket is for documentation related to a release, the documentation needs to be complete at least 10 days prior to release. Please ensure you allow sufficient time for your request to be completed or it will be moved to the next available slot.\n\n### Editing requests\n\nWhen submitting a PR for documentation, whether it's a minor update, a new piece of content, or a content proposal, please add the **Editor Review** label (if possible). Once the Technical Writer/Editor has reviewed the PR they'll remove the label. When all the requested reviews are complete, the **Reviews Complete** label is applied and the changes are merged.\n\n### Providing editorial feedback\n\nIf you're asked to provide editorial feedback on a PR, and it's your first editorial feedback request, first read up on the review process [here](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/code-review) to get an idea of what's expected in terms of turnaround time, type of feedback, and so on.\n\nEditorial feedback is based on the guidelines laid out in the [Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/core.html#documentation-style-guide) as well as the [Voice, Tone, and Writing Style Guide](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/publishing/publishing-guidelines/voice-tone-and-writing-style-guidelines).\n\n### Formatting and Style Guide\n\nThe [Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/core.html#documentation-style-guide) and [UI text guidelines](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/documentation-UItext-guidelines.html).\n\n## Community documentation involvement\n\nEvery month the Mattermost community plans, builds, tests, documents, releases, and supports new product improvements for Team Edition to benefit the user community. The Mattermost Enterprise Team does the same for Enterprise Edition to benefit the subscriber community.\n\nA critical part of this development is documentation which ranges from feature documentation to FAQs, guides, and tutorials.\n\n### Feature documentation\n\nFeature documentation is a collaborative effort between the Product Manager and Technical Writer within a specific timeframe aligned with releases. Community members are welcome to assist, if the time expectations are manageable. \n\nFeature request documentation is usually located in the [mattermost-server](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ADocs%2FNeeded) repo and the [mattermost-webapp](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3ADocs%2FNeeded) repo and are labelled as ``Docs/Needed``. As these are tied to a release \\(and a deadline\\) it\u2019s best to only take on the work if you\u2019re sure you can complete it on time. It\u2019s understood that community members contribute in their available time, which is why this type of documentation isn\u2019t usually the best option to take on.\n\n### Help Wanted tickets/doc issues\n\nHelp Wanted tickets are generally not linked to a release and are more flexible in terms of timeline and delivery date. You can find the documentation Help Wanted tickets [here](https://github.com/mattermost/docs/labels/Help%20Wanted). To start working on one, assign it to yourself, add a comment indicating you\u2019ll be working on it, find the relevant document in the [source](https://github.com/mattermost/docs/tree/master/source) directory, read through the [README](https://github.com/mattermost/docs/blob/master/README.md) file if you're not familiar with the process, and get started.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can post them in the [Documentation](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/documentation) channel and we'll be happy to help.\n\n### Engineering/developer documentation\n\nMost, if not all, contributions to the Mattermost project have a documentation impact. As part of the development and submission process, it\u2019s recommended that the relevant documentation be updated \\(or created\\) and included in the PR. This provides consistency and accuracy in communicating the changes/new feature and cuts down on having multiple issues and PRs for related documentation.\n\nVisit the [Contribute to Documentation](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/publishing/publishing-guidelines/voice-tone-and-writing-style-guidelines/submitting-documentation-with-your-pr) page to get started with submitting documentation with your PR. You can read more about the review process [here](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/code-review).\n",

        "content": "# Technical Writing Workflows\n\nThe team uses different branching strategies for day-to-day, staging, and release documentation for documentation in the [docs repo](https://github.com/mattermost/docs).\n\n## General workflow\n\nThis process applies to general work, such as ad-hoc editing and adding new content/pages to the docs.\n\n### Adding new content\n\n1. Create a branch off `master`.\n2. Navigate to the directory you're working in.\n3. Select **Add file > Create new file**.\n4. Give your file a name with the file format as `.rst`.\n5. Edit your file.\n6. When you're finished, add an optional description of your change.\n7. Optionally, rename your branch.\n8. Select **Commit new file**.\n9. On the following page, enter a helpful title for the pull request (this adds immediate context for reviewers)..\n10. Then select reviewers and add labels.\n11. Finally, select **Create pull request**.\n12. You can find your PR under the **Pull requests** tab in GitHub.\n\nShortly after you open your PR, you'll be alerted that the preview is available to view. This preview is linked to the PR and shows only these changes. Select the link provided to view the preview, validate links, and review formatting.\n\n### Editing content\n\n1. Create a branch off `master`.\n2. Navigate to the directory you're working in.\n3. Select the pencil icon to open the file for editing.\n4. Edit the file.\n6. When you're finished, add an optional description of your change and optionally, rename your branch.\n7. Select **Commit changes**.\n8. On the following page, enter a helpful title for the pull request (this adds immediate context for reviewers).\n9. In the description box, provide a navigation outline for reviewers to make it easier for them to navigate to the changes.\n10. Then select reviewers and add labels.\n11. Finally, select **Create pull request**.\n12. You can find your PR under the **Pull requests** tab in GitHub.\n\nShortly after you open your PR, you'll be alerted that the preview is available to view. This preview is linked to the PR and shows only these changes. Select the link provided to view the preview, validate links, and review formatting.\n\n## Staging workflow\n\nThis process applies to large documentation projects that use a staging branch for testing and previews prior to merge.\n\n#### What is the staging branch?\n\nThe `staging` branch is a branch off `master` where changes for long-running projects are made, previewed, and tested before being pushed to prod.\n\n#### How do I work in the staging environment?\n\nIf you're editing content in the `staging` branch, you'll create a new branch off the `staging` branch for your changes. You're able to view a preview of your changes in your PR. When your PR is reviewed and approved, it's merged into the `staging` branch by one of the technical writers and is then visible in that branch's preview. Eventually, once all the change branches are merged into the `staging` branch and the project is approved, it's merged into `master`.\n\n#### How does the staging branch stay aligned with master?\n\nThe `staging` branch automatically checks for changes in `master` and provides a prompt to update when changes are detected. Once `staging` is updated, any branches off `staging` will also display a prompt to **Update branch**. In most cases there shouldn't be any merge conflicts but if there are, please read the Merge conflicts section.\n\n#### Creating a staging branch\n\nCreate a branch off `master` called `staging`.\n\n#### Creating new content in staging\n\n1. Switch to the `staging` branch.\n2. Navigate to the directory you're working in.\n3. Select **Add file > Create new file**.\n4. Give your file a name with the file format as `.rst`.\n5. Edit your file.\n6. When you're finished, add an optional description of your change.\n7. Optionally, rename your branch.\n8. Select **Commit new file**.\n9. On the following page, enter a helpful title for the pull request.\n10. Then select reviewers and add labels.\n11. Add the label `staging` to your PR.\n12. In most cases, staging work is in progress so you can also add the `Work in progress` label.\n13. Finally, select **Create pull request**.\n14. You can find your PR under the **Pull requests** tab in GitHub.\n\n### Editing content in staging\n\n1. Switch to the `staging` branch.\n2. Navigate to the directory you're working in.\n3. Select the pencil icon to open the file for editing.\n4. Edit the file.\n5. When you're finished, add an optional description of your change and optionally, rename your branch.\n6. Ensure that you select the option to **Create a new branch** - do not commit directly to the `staging` branch.\n7. Select **Commit changes**.\n8. On the following page, enter a helpful title for the pull request (this adds immediate context for reviewers).\n9. In the description box, provide a navigation outline for reviewers to make it easier for them to navigate to the changes.\n10. Then select reviewers and add labels.\n11. Finally, select **Create pull request**.\n12.

This preview is linked to the PR and shows only these changes. Select the link provided to view the preview, validate links, and review formatting.\n\n## Merge conflicts\n\nTODO\n\n## Release documentation workflow\n\nThis process applies to release documentation.\n\n#### Creating new content in staging\n\n1. Switch to the `vx.xx Documentation` branch.\n2. Navigate to the directory you're working in.\n3. Select **Add file > Create new file**.\n4. Give your file a name with the file format as `.rst`.\n5. Edit your file.\n6. When you're finished, add an optional description of your change.\n7. Optionally, rename your branch.\n8. Select **Commit new file**.\n9.

        "title": "Technical Writing Team Handbook",
        "content": "# Technical Writing Team Handbook\n\n## Technical Writing Handbook\n\nMattermost Technical Writers focus primarily on writing, editing, structuring, and maintaining Mattermost technical and product documentation, end user documentation for Mattermost Channels, Boards, and Playbooks, as well as developer documentation and the company Handbook. Technical Writers also manage in-product microcopy, provide editorial reviews for all documentation across the organization, and work closely with the community to improve documentation.\n\n### Areas of responsibility \\(AORs\\)\n\nDocumentation and technical writing at Mattermost covers \\(but isn't limited to\\) the following verticals:\n\n* Channels\n  * Mattermost Cloud\n  * Self-managed deployments\n  * Messaging features and functionality\n* Playbooks\n* Boards\n* Calls\n* Growth\n* Self-service\n  * Customer Portal\n  * Telemetry\n* Apps Framework and Marketplace\n\nOther areas of documentation include:\n\n* Mattermost Handbook\n* Integrations \\(developer documentation, plugin documentation, and developer journey\\)\n* Documentation metrics:\n  * Docs page ratings via Google Analytics\n  * Google Analytics metrics for page visits, read times, and bounce rates\n  * Customer feedback analysis\n  * Metrics dashboards using RudderStack\n* In-product messaging and interface\n* GitLab documentation for:\n  * [GitLab Mattermost docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/gitlab-mattermost/%20)\n  * GitLab helm chart docs\n* Developer documentation for:\n  * [developers.mattermost.com](https://developers.mattermost.com), including Contribute, Integrate, and Extend sections\n  * [api.mattermost.com](https://api.mattermost.com)\n  * General developer experience docs, e.g. code samples, best practices, and tutorials\n* Community and doc review process\n  * Process for Doc Up plugin\n  * Docs review and release coordination\n  * Community Help Wanted doc issues\n* Content and processes\n  * PR reviews across the organization\n  * Documentation processes for release PRs\n\nPlease reach out to the [Documentation Working Group](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/dwg-documentation-working-group) for any questions.\n\n## How to contribute to the documentation\n\nOur documentation is open to contributions from anyone. The basic outline for getting started with contributions is provided in the [README](https://github.com/mattermost/docs/blob/master/README.md) of the docs repo. If you have write access to the repo, you can create a branch off master and work on that.\n\nOnce complete, submit your Pull Request \\(PR\\). Ensure that you assign appropriate approvers and labels - if you've forked the repo or don't have the correct repo permissions you may not be able to do this, so you can skip this step. Read more about the review process [here](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/code-review) - it applies to various types of contributions including documentation.\n\n### PR tips and best practices\n\n* Try to submit files in batches rather than single PRs for each file update. This reduces the PR load and also groups your changes more effectively.\n* When there are lots of changes requested, especially on a docs PR that doesn't require QA testing, you can use the \"Add suggestion to batch\" feature in GitHub to commit all of the suggestions at once. You need to be on the **Files changed** tab to use this feature, though it's also shown on the **Conversation** tab. By batching your suggestions, you can use one commit message such as \"Added batch suggestions from @Carrie Warner\". This just makes the commit history of the PR a lot more readable and useful for everyone reviewing it.\n* Descriptive PR titles and commit messages go a long way, especially when the PR is referenced in the future. The default PR titles that GitHub gives us like \"Updated README.md\" are not very helpful because there's no way to know the purpose of the PR by reading the title. For example, if the whole file was translated to Japanese because we realize that's our main audience, that information isn't obvious unless you open the PR and read it - or if it's in the PR title.\n\n## Style Guide and UI writing guides\n\nOur [Documentation Style Guide] is a guide to writing Mattermost product documentation and includes guidelines around punctuation, casing, and how to format files. We also have [a guide for writing UI copy](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/development-process/user-interface-text-guidelines) which includes tip, best practices, and examples.\n\n## i18n contributions\n\n**Note: This process is in flight.***\n\nOur product documentation is available for translation contributions. Join the [i18n channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/localization) on our Community server and connect with our translation community members. The documentation translation process is still being defined, and @cwarnermm is the DRI along with members of the Localization team.\n\nCurrently, submitting a translation PR follows the same writing and editing process as other PRs. However, there are additional considerations to bear in mind when submitting your PR as these assist with the approval and merge process:\n\n1. Do you have an active test instance running with the integrations guide translated so we can validate the rendering and formatting?\n2. If the content you're translating includes screenshots should we keep the original English versions of the screenshots, or consider translated versions of them too?\n3. If the intention is to translate the screenshots, is there a proposed process for keeping them up to date?\n4. Have at least one member of UX team and one member of Apps PM team review the user experience in choosing different languages.\n5. To maintain high standards for translated documentation, set up a process to notify translators when something is changed in the English-version of the docs, and expectation on correcting translations for new releases.\n6. Decide if we want to indicate translations level - e.g. \u201cAlpha\u201d or \u201cBeta\u201d for translations that are in progress.\n7. Test you can successfully rate a translated docs page by selecting a rating emoji. Ping @justine.geffen for validation of this.\n\n## Set up a local development environment\n\nMembers of the writing team have two ways to contribute to Mattermost product documentation:\n\n- Using GitHub web tools. See the GitHub training section below for details.\n- Working within a local development environment. See the mattermost/docs repository [README](https://github.com/mattermost/docs#building-and-validating) documentation for details on setting up a local environment.\n\n### Clone a documentation fork locally\n\nMattermost product documentation contributions can be created in one of two ways:\n\n- As a branch (applies only Mattermost staff with appropriate GitHub repository permissions).\n- As a fork (applies to all other documentation contributions).\n\nIn a GitHub documentation PR, branched contributions display using the branch name, and forked contributions display as `username/reponame:branchname` instead. While branched contributions are automatically pulled down to a local environment when you run the command `git pull` or `git fetch origin` from the command line, forked contributions must be pulled down manually.\n\nTo work with a forked contribution locally:\n\n1. In the GitHub PR, identify the contributor's username.\n2. In your local file system, create a new directory for the fork.\n3. Navigate to the new directory, then clone the fork by running the command `git clone https://github.com/username/reponame`. Note that you don't need to specify the branch name.\n4. Switch to the branch you want to explore by running the command `git checkout branchname`.\n5. (macOS users only) Sync your virtual environment for the new directory by running the command `pipenv sync`.\n\n## Extend Sphinx functionality\n\nExtending product documentation functionality typically involves extending the Sphinx static generation tool with extensions that introduce new display, page, build, navigation, or output capabilities. For example, all code blocks on all pages of the product documentation feature a copy/paste option to make trying out code samples easy for documentation visitors. The copy/paste option was added by installing a Sphinx extension created by an open source contributor.\n\nTo get started with Sphinx extensions, you'll want to set up a local development environment, then identify an open source Sphinx extension you want to test based on an outcome or goal you're looking to achieve that improves the learning experience for Mattermost documentation visitors.\n\n1. In a local documentation development environment, from the command line terminal, install the Sphinx extension using the installation instructions provided by the extension author.\n2. Regenerate the `pipenv.lock` file by running the following command: `pipenv install sphinx-extension==version` where `version` is replaced with the extension's release version you want to use.\n3. Update the `conf.py` file to add the extension in the `extension` section. \n4. Incorporate the new Sphinx extension on a documentation page using appropriate syntax.\n5. Build the documentation locally to test how the extension works. Be sure to test as many edge cases and real world situations as you can to ensure that the new extended functionality won't break existing pages or content.\n\n## Upgrade Sphinx\n\nMattermost product documentation is generated using Sphinx v4.4. As new Sphinx functionality becomes available, it can be desirable or necessary to upgrade Sphinx to a later release.\n\nTo get started with a Sphinx upgrade, you'll want to set up a local development environment, then review the [Sphinx release history](https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/#history) to identify the upgrade version you want. It's important to understand and test upgrades locally to identify any risks an upgrade may introduce to the Mattermost documentation.\n\nOnce you have a Sphinx upgrade version in mind:\n\n1. In a local documentation development environment, from the command line terminal, install the Sphinx upgrade by running the following command: `pipenv install sphinx==version`. This command updates both the `pipfile` with the latest Sphinx version and regenerates the `pipfile.lock`.\n2. Sync your virtual environment for the new Sphinx version by running the command: `pipenv sync`.\n3. Create a documentation PR containing the two file changes to `pipfile` and `pipfile.lock`.\n4. Once the PR merged into production, writers can update their local development environments to use the Sphinx upgrade by running the following command: `pipenv sync`.\n\nFollowing a successful Sphinx upgrade, complete the following checklist tasks to ensure that the new version of Sphinx doesn't impact existing functionality, content, or output.\n\n### Sitemap generation\n\n1. Open the latest sitemap via `docs.mattermost.com/sitemap.xml` in a browser tab.\n2. Generate the product documentation, then use a text compare tool such as [text-compare](https://text-compare.com/) to review the differences between the newly generated sitemap against what's available in production.\n\nYou shouldn't see any glaring differences and the sitemap should NOT have any Mattermost version information in any of the URLs. You may see content move around on the page. Confirm that page URLs in production continue to exist in the latest generated sitemap XML file.\n\n### Page redirects\n\nSpot check a handful of redirects specified via the `conf.py` file to ensure they continue to redirect visitors correctly.\n\n### Parallel processing and pickling\n\nWhen you build the documentation locally, is the build fast? Do you see a message in the terminal indicating that pickling was successful?\n\nIf the build takes more than a few minutes to complete, or you don't see the pickling success message, this could indicate an issue with the Sphinx version, and you may want to reconsider an upgrade to this version.\n\n### HTML output\n\nAfter successfully building the product documentation:\n\n- Navigate around the site to ensure that nothing looks or feels broken.\n- Review pages with tables and tabbed content to ensure the content displays as intended.\n- Review the landing page as well as subsequent page headers/footers to ensure links take users to expected destinations.\n- Review the Changelog pages (which are managed in Markdown source files) to ensure that the changelogs are converted to HTML correctly.\n- Perform a few docs searches to confirm that searches continue to work as expected.\n\n### Build warnings and errors\n\nReview and fix issues reported via the `/build/warnings.log` file including broken links, pages missing from the LHS, and syntax and formatting problems. \n\n### Review documentation repository setup instructions\n\n- In GitHub, review the [mattermost/docs](https://github.com/mattermost/docs) repository [README file](https://github.com/mattermost/docs#mattermost-documentation) and this Handbook process documentation to ensure content accuracy.\n\n## GitHub training\n\nGitHub training videos coming soon!\n\n### Add PRs to monthly documentation release branches\n\nIf you encounter a documentation PR that should be included in a monthly documentation release cycle, instead of tracking the PR individually, the PR can be merged into a documentation release branch. \n\n1. In the PR, identify the branch name you want to include in a documentation release branch. \n2. Ensure your local development environment is up-to-date and contains the same code as the `master` branch.\n3. Navigate into the branch where you want to merge in the PR to ensure all code is available locally.\n4. From a terminal, run the command `git merge branchname` where `branchname` is the name of the branch you want to commit to a monthly documentation release.\n5. If there are no conflicts, you'll see the vi editor. Review the commit message, then type `:x` to save and exit. If there are conflicts, you need to resolve them on the CLI and commit them first before you can move to the next step to push remotely.\n6. Push your changes remotely by running the command `git push`.\n",

The basic outline for getting started with contributions is provided in the <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/docs/blob/master/README.md\">README</a> of the docs repo. If you have write access to the repo, you can create a branch off master and work on that.</p>\n<p>Once complete, submit your Pull Request (PR). Ensure that you assign appropriate approvers and labels - if you've forked the repo or don't have the correct repo permissions you may not be able to do this, so you can skip this step. Read more about the review process <a href=\"https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/code-review\">here</a> - it applies to various types of contributions including documentation.</p>\n<h3>PR tips and best practices</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to submit files in batches rather than single PRs for each file update. This reduces the PR load and also groups your changes more effectively.</li>\n<li>When there are lots of changes requested, especially on a docs PR that doesn't require QA testing, you can use the \"Add suggestion to batch\" feature in GitHub to commit all of the suggestions at once. You need to be on the <strong>Files changed</strong> tab to use this feature, though it's also shown on the <strong>Conversation</strong> tab. By batching your suggestions, you can use one commit message such as \"Added batch suggestions from @Carrie Warner\". This just makes the commit history of the PR a lot more readable and useful for everyone reviewing it.</li>\n<li>Descriptive PR titles and commit messages go a long way, especially when the PR is referenced in the future. The default PR titles that GitHub gives us like \"Updated README.md\" are not very helpful because there's no way to know the purpose of the PR by reading the title. For example, if the whole file was translated to Japanese because we realize that's our main audience, that information isn't obvious unless you open the PR and read it - or if it's in the PR title.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Style Guide and UI writing guides</h2>\n<p>Our [Documentation Style Guide] is a guide to writing Mattermost product documentation and includes guidelines around punctuation, casing, and how to format files. We also have <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/development-process/user-interface-text-guidelines\">a guide for writing UI copy</a> which includes tip, best practices, and examples.</p>\n<h2>i18n contributions</h2>\n<p><strong>Note: This process is in flight.</strong>*</p>\n<p>Our product documentation is available for translation contributions.

        "title": "User Interface Text Guidelines",
        "content": "# User Interface Text Guidelines\n\nMattermost user interface content (microcopy) is where we can set our users up for success and build engagement with the product instead of reliance on documentation.\n\nWhen we write copy for our product messaging our primary goals are to:\n\n* Write with empathy\n* Provide context\n* Help users build mental models\n* Reduce cognitive load\n* Proactively prevent failure\n\nTo achieve these goals, we ensure that we have the right content for the right user at the right time. In addition to this, we prioritize:\n\n* Plain language: We choose natural language, simple words, and short sentences for documentation and in-product text.\n* Readability: We strive to make our documentation pages easy to scan and not overwhelming.\n* Consistency: We ensure that we all refer to the same things using the same words or names, to avoid confusion.\n\nThese writing principles mean that we think like a friend, and talk like a coach to reduce friction and increase satisfaction. \n\n* Keep in mind that your users are from all over the world. \n* Use the present tense to describe a current state or condition, and the future tense to state something that is very definitely going to happen.\n* Use the active voice, except for these cases:\n  * If you\u2019ll end up blaming the user. For example, don\u2019t say **You entered an incorrect password**. Instead, say **The password is incorrect**.\n  * If you\u2019re describing what just happened. For example: **Your incoming webhook is set up**.\n  * If the subject \\(the doer of an action\\) is the Mattermost application itself. For example: **The image has been deleted** instead of **The server deleted the image**.\n* If you\u2019re asking the user to do or not do something, use imperatives \\(command phrases\\). For example, use **Don't change the Hostname** instead of **It's not recommended to change the Hostname**. Better still, explain what could go wrong if they do or don\u2019t do something. For example: **Don't change the Hostname because doing so will break something**.\n\n## Types of in-product content\n\nIn general, users will encounter the following types of messaging when using Mattermost:\n\n* Help, hints, or informative text\n* Calls to action\n* Confirmation dialogs\n* Errors\n* Notifications\n\nIn general, this content is either:\n\n* Static text on the user interface\n* An actionable button which leads to a process\n* Triggered because something happened\n\n## Writing for inclusion and diversity\n\nThis section is being built out. In the meantime, please consult [this page](https://writer.com/inclusion-glossary/) for the type of guidelines we follow when writing with inclusion and diversity in mind.\n\nIf you have any questions about writing for inclusion and diversity, or notice something we can improve, please tell us! You can find us on Mattermost in the [DWG: Documentation Working Group](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/dwg-documentation-working-group) channel.\n\n## Accessibility\n\nThis section is being built out. In the meantime, here are some of the things we take into account when writing content:\n\n- [ALT tags](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AKY1iEkN6iDwJbsHQ-vcEkJvjtLKmq0pKYDwKLmSffs/edit)\n- Colors used on-screen\n- Plain and clear language\n\nTake a look at [this article](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/writing-accessible-microcopy/) for some more information on accessibility. \n\nHave any ideas or feedback? You can find us on Mattermost in the [DWG: Documentation Working Group](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/dwg-documentation-working-group) channel.\n\n## Messaging guidelines\n\nDon\u2019t blame the user. Inform them about what happened, explain why it happened, and suggest a way forward. Try to use complete sentences in your messages. A sentence phrase \\(an incomplete sentence\\) might make sense in English but could present internationalization challenges.\n\n### System messages\n\nSystem messages can be one of the following types: **notification**, **confirmation**, **warning**, and **error**. The following sections contain guidelines that are specific to each of these types.\n\nIf a system message contains variables \\(tokens\\):\n\n* Don't use verbs or adjectives as variables.\n* Don't create plurals of variables by adding an \"s\".\n* If the variable is a noun, use a qualifier after the variable. For example, say **The {channel\\_name} channel was created** rather than **The {channel\\_name} was created**.\n\n### Notification messages\n\nA notification message informs the user about an event or action that took place. These messages don't need any user input, and don't prevent the user from continuing to use Mattermost.\n\n* Use either a complete sentence or a sentence phrase.\n* If using a complete sentence, end it with a period.\n* Examples:\n  * **Member added to channel.**\n  * **The plugin was installed.**\n\n### Confirmation messages\n\nA confirmation message requires user input to confirm that they want to proceed with the action. Confirmation must be provided \\(either to continue or cancel\\) before the user can continue to use Mattermost.\n\n* Use complete sentences.\n* Include a question that has a Yes/No answer.\n* Examples:\n  * **Are you sure you want to delete this channel?**\n  * **A plugin with this ID already exists. Would you like to overwrite it?**\n\n### Warning messages\n\nA warning message alerts the user that something that might go wrong. They can continue using Mattermost unless the warning message needs user input.\n\n* Use complete sentences.\n* Explain what has happened, or can happen, and what may go wrong as a result.\n* Examples:\n  * **The Enterprise license expires in 2 days. If it's not renewed, some features will be disabled on license expiry.**\n  * **If you claim this AD/LDAP account, you won't be able to log in with your email address.**\n\n### Error messages\n\nAn error message informs the user that something went wrong. Errors prevent the user from completing a task or accessing a feature until the error is resolved.\n\n* Use complete sentences.\n* If what went wrong isn\u2019t obvious, explain in one sentence.\n* If a solution or workaround isn\u2019t obvious, suggest one.\n* Examples:\n  * **Messages must have fewer than 120 characters.**\n  * **A connection to the Marketplace server could not be established. Check your settings in the **System Console**.**\n\n## In-product copy\n\nThe Technical Writers often work with the UI/UX team on in-product copy. The majority of guidelines are available in the [Mattermost Compass Design System](https://zeroheight.com/29be2c109/p/995619-compass-design-system).\n\n### How we make in-product text changes\n\nWhile its possible to manage in-product text changes using GitHub web tools, writers may find it more straightforward to clone each of the main Mattermost repositories, including [webapp](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp), [server](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server), [mobile](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile), and [desktop](https://github.com/mattermost/desktop), and work through text changes in a local development environment instead. \n\nMaking an in-product text change starts with identifying which repository, and where in the product code, a change is needed. Many in-product strings live in the `mattermost/webapp/i18n/en.json` or `mattermost/server/i18n/en.json` English translation files. However, some strings may additionally live within product code too. You may need to update both `.json` and `.tsx` files. QA can help apply updates to impacted SNAP or E2E files.\n\nIf TSX files are impacted by an in-product change, run the command `npm run updatesnapshot ./directory-or-file` to capture any TXS changes within the `en.json` file. Run this command against multiple files by separating files with spaces: `npm run updatesnapshot -i ./path_to_test.txt_file ./path_to_test.txt_file ./path_to_test.txt_file`\n\nIf E2E tests are failing during PR reviews, reach out for assistance from either the team who initiated the feature or the SDET, QA team. Then, add the **QA Needed** label for all in-product text change PRs. If you know the QA team member based on the affected product area, add them as a QA reviewer, otherwise mention the QA Lead in the PR notes.\n\n### How we write things (WIP)\n\nWe write with empathy in the context of achievement using natural language. This can be quite hard to do; as technical writers we generally lean toward very clear and concise writing that can feel clinical. Writing more naturally means we try to avoid convoluted phrasing and we try to make things more simple.\n\nSo, instead of saying: \"When testing the Java app ensure your third-party connection is secure before initiating the test sequence.\" rather say: \"Make sure your third-party connection is secure before testing the app.\"\n\nBecause we strive to use natural language, the way we phrase microcopy isn't templated - that would defeat the point. Instead, here are some examples of microcopy we use for various features and products. The common theme is clarity and empathy.\n\n#### Which words to use\n\nThere's a big difference between \"jargon\" and \"terminology\".\n\nJargon is usually industry-specific and can be isolating or confusing for users who aren't deeply familiar with them. Terminology is usually universally-accepted and generally understood.\n\n### Guidelines for UI punctuation\n\n**Headings**\n\nThese are H1 headings such as the title of a modal. Titles shouldn't have periods unless the headline is more than one sentence. Titles also shouldn't contain punctuation such as question marks, colons, semi-colons.\n\n**Paragraphs**\n\nParagraphs should always be properly punctuated.\n\n**Sentences**\n\nWhen you're writing descriptive UI copy, try to write full sentences which can be punctuated. If the copy you're writing can be expressed in a single word, consider moving that word to the input field instead.\n\n**Bullets**\n\nBullet lists shouldn't have periods unless the bullet text is more than one sentence.\n\n**Button labels**\n\nButton labels shouldn't have periods or other punctuation.\n\n### Guidelines for capitalization\n\nWe follow the same capitalization rules across all our documentation assets, including in-product text and UI elements: Always use sentence case (except where you're using a proper noun, of course). This applies to:\n\n* Page titles\n* Page headings\n* Section headings\n* Button labels\n* Input labels\n* Navigation labels\n* Menu items\n* Field hint text \n* Hover text\n\nHere's an example of an incorrect heading: *This Article is About Mattermost*. The correct version is: *This article is about Mattermost*.\n\nTake a look at the [Google guide to capitalization](https://developers.google.com/style/capitalization) for more information about how we approach casing. \n\n## Terminology\n\nOne way of making life easier for our customers is to ensure we are consistent with our terminology. The technical writing team is continually working on improving our users' experience with our documentation and copy. You can read more about this work [here](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/technical-writing-team-handbook/our-terminology).\n\n## Button labels and links\n\nButton labels should always use action words and describe the action as concisely as possible. They should be limited to four words or less. Examples: \u201cLog in\u201d, \u201cSend invitation\u201d.\n\n## Navigation labels\n\nNavigation labels should be as short as possible and support the user in finding their way.\n\n### Input labels\n\nInput labels should be as short and concise as possible and describe the input field.\n\n## Guidelines for UI elements\n\nUse this table when writing the text for UI elements such as windows, dialog boxes, labels, and prompts.\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th style=\"text-align:left\">Element</th>\n      <th style=\"text-align:left\">Image</th>\n      <th

        "html": "<h1>User Interface Text Guidelines</h1>\n<p>Mattermost user interface content (microcopy) is where we can set our users up for success and build engagement with the product instead of reliance on documentation.</p>\n<p>When we write copy for our product messaging our primary goals are to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write with empathy</li>\n<li>Provide context</li>\n<li>Help users build mental models</li>\n<li>Reduce cognitive load</li>\n<li>Proactively prevent failure</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To achieve these goals, we ensure that we have the right content for the right user at the right time. In addition to this, we prioritize:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plain language: We choose natural language, simple words, and short sentences for documentation and in-product text.</li>\n<li>Readability: We strive to make our documentation pages easy to scan and not overwhelming.</li>\n<li>Consistency: We ensure that we all refer to the same things using the same words or names, to avoid confusion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These writing principles mean that we think like a friend, and talk like a coach to reduce friction and increase satisfaction. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep in mind that your users are from all over the world. </li>\n<li>Use the present tense to describe a current state or condition, and the future tense to state something that is very definitely going to happen.</li>\n<li>Use the active voice, except for these cases:</li>\n<li>If you\u2019ll end up blaming the user. For example, don\u2019t say <strong>You entered an incorrect password</strong>. Instead, say <strong>The password is incorrect</strong>.</li>\n<li>If you\u2019re describing what just happened. For example: <strong>Your incoming webhook is set up</strong>.</li>\n<li>If the subject (the doer of an action) is the Mattermost application itself. For example: <strong>The image has been deleted</strong> instead of <strong>The server deleted the image</strong>.</li>\n<li>If you\u2019re asking the user to do or not do something, use imperatives (command phrases). For example, use <strong>Don't change the Hostname</strong> instead of <strong>It's not recommended to change the Hostname</strong>. Better still, explain what could go wrong if they do or don\u2019t do something. For example: <strong>Don't change the Hostname because doing so will break something</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Types of in-product content</h2>\n<p>In general, users will encounter the following types of messaging when using Mattermost:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Help, hints, or informative text</li>\n<li>Calls to action</li>\n<li>Confirmation dialogs</li>\n<li>Errors</li>\n<li>Notifications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In general, this content is either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Static text on the user interface</li>\n<li>An actionable button which leads to a process</li>\n<li>Triggered because something happened</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Writing for inclusion and diversity</h2>\n<p>This section is being built out. In the meantime, please consult <a href=\"https://writer.com/inclusion-glossary/\">this page</a> for the type of guidelines we follow when writing with inclusion and diversity in mind.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about writing for inclusion and diversity, or notice something we can improve, please tell us! You can find us on Mattermost in the <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/dwg-documentation-working-group\">DWG: Documentation Working Group</a> channel.</p>\n<h2>Accessibility</h2>\n<p>This section is being built out. In the meantime, here are some of the things we take into account when writing content:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AKY1iEkN6iDwJbsHQ-vcEkJvjtLKmq0pKYDwKLmSffs/edit\">ALT tags</a></li>\n<li>Colors used on-screen</li>\n<li>Plain and clear language</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Take a look at <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/writing-accessible-microcopy/\">this article</a> for some more information on accessibility. </p>\n<p>Have any ideas or feedback? You can find us on Mattermost in the <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/dwg-documentation-working-group\">DWG: Documentation Working Group</a> channel.</p>\n<h2>Messaging guidelines</h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t blame the user. Inform them about what happened, explain why it happened, and suggest a way forward. Try to use complete sentences in your messages. A sentence phrase (an incomplete sentence) might make sense in English but could present internationalization challenges.</p>\n<h3>System messages</h3>\n<p>System messages can be one of the following types: <strong>notification</strong>, <strong>confirmation</strong>, <strong>warning</strong>, and <strong>error</strong>. The following sections contain guidelines that are specific to each of these types.</p>\n<p>If a system message contains variables (tokens):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't use verbs or adjectives as variables.</li>\n<li>Don't create plurals of variables by adding an \"s\".</li>\n<li>If the variable is a noun, use a qualifier after the variable. For example, say <strong>The {channel_name} channel was created</strong> rather than <strong>The {channel_name} was created</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Notification messages</h3>\n<p>A notification message informs the user about an event or action that took place. These messages don't need any user input, and don't prevent the user from continuing to use Mattermost.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use either a complete sentence or a sentence phrase.</li>\n<li>If using a complete sentence, end it with a period.</li>\n<li>Examples:</li>\n<li><strong>Member added to channel.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The plugin was installed.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Confirmation messages</h3>\n<p>A confirmation message requires user input to confirm that they want to proceed with the action. Confirmation must be provided (either to continue or cancel) before the user can continue to use Mattermost.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use complete sentences.</li>\n<li>Include a question that has a Yes/No answer.</li>\n<li>Examples:</li>\n<li><strong>Are you sure you want to delete this channel?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A plugin with this ID already exists. Would you like to overwrite it?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Warning messages</h3>\n<p>A warning message alerts the user that something that might go wrong. They can continue using Mattermost unless the warning message needs user input.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use complete sentences.</li>\n<li>Explain what has happened, or can happen, and what may go wrong as a result.</li>\n<li>Examples:</li>\n<li><strong>The Enterprise license expires in 2 days. If it's not renewed, some features will be disabled on license expiry.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>If you claim this AD/LDAP account, you won't be able to log in with your email address.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Error messages</h3>\n<p>An error message informs the user that something went wrong. Errors prevent the user from completing a task or accessing a feature until the error is resolved.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use complete sentences.</li>\n<li>If what went wrong isn\u2019t obvious, explain in one sentence.</li>\n<li>If a solution or workaround isn\u2019t obvious, suggest one.</li>\n<li>Examples:</li>\n<li><strong>Messages must have fewer than 120 characters.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A connection to the Marketplace server could not be established. Check your settings in the </strong>System Console<strong>.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>In-product copy</h2>\n<p>The Technical Writers often work with the UI/UX team on in-product copy. The majority of guidelines are available in the <a href=\"https://zeroheight.com/29be2c109/p/995619-compass-design-system\">Mattermost Compass Design System</a>.</p>\n<h3>How we make in-product text changes</h3>\n<p>While its possible to manage in-product text changes using GitHub web tools, writers may find it more straightforward to clone each of the main Mattermost repositories, including <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp\">webapp</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server\">server</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile\">mobile</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/desktop\">desktop</a>, and work through text changes in a local development environment instead. </p>\n<p>Making an in-product text change starts with identifying which repository, and where in the product code, a change is needed. Many in-product strings live in the <code>mattermost/webapp/i18n/en.json</code> or <code>mattermost/server/i18n/en.json</code> English translation files. However, some strings may additionally live within product code too. You may need to update both <code>.json</code> and <code>.tsx</code> files. QA can help apply updates to impacted SNAP or E2E files.</p>\n<p>If TSX files are impacted by an in-product change, run the command <code>npm run updatesnapshot ./directory-or-file</code> to capture any TXS changes within the <code>en.json</code> file. Run this command against multiple files by separating files with spaces: <code>npm run updatesnapshot -i ./path_to_test.txt_file ./path_to_test.txt_file ./path_to_test.txt_file</code></p>\n<p>If E2E tests are failing during PR reviews, reach out for assistance from either the team who initiated the feature or the SDET, QA team. Then, add the <strong>QA Needed</strong> label for all in-product text change PRs. If you know the QA team member based on the affected product area, add them as a QA reviewer, otherwise mention the QA Lead in the PR notes.</p>\n<h3>How we write things (WIP)</h3>\n<p>We write with empathy in the context of achievement using natural language.

When we use consistent terminology it means we're all speaking the same language, and our customers know what to expect whether they're on the website or in the product documentation.\n\nTerminology standardization started in 2022. The project has a large scope and includes:\n\n- Standardizing headings to make them sentence case.\n- Standardizing all text in the System Console to make them sentence case.\n- Standardizing how we refer to our products and plans, as well as the mechanisms available to use them.\n- Changing the casing of words to lowercase where appropriate.\n- Making our Edition and License page in the System Console consistent and clear.\n- Creating a UI text library of terms and strings for teams and external partners to use when creating mockups, designs, wireframes, and integrations.\n\nThe [outline of the project is documented here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ImzS3UhCkFzMF2-6FNByw9W2r8Gvx1sudBA0FjazVH0/edit#heading=h.crjl4fz9pz1n).\n\n## Sentence case headings\n\nWe decided to change our headings to sentence case to:\n\n* Decrease friction for contributors so they wouldn't have to guess at getting heading capitalization right.\n* Bring our documentation format in line with current industry standards around readability.\n* Make our documentation easier to read.\n\nThis is a work in progress with documentation updates delivered in Q1 of 2022. The scope of the project extends to the Mattermost website, developer documentation, Handbook, and integrations content. There is no date set for completion.\n\n## In-product text\n\nCurrently, all our in-product text uses title case. This is jarring.\n\nIn Q3 of 2022, this will be tackled incrementally, in sections corresponding to the menu layout in the System Console. This will be done in consultation with the QA team as well as the Localization team.\n\n## Names of things\n\nWhat we call our icons, features, apps, and services is inconsistent purely in terms of casing. We have kicked off a process to standardize the casing of most of the icons, features, apps, and services to write them in lowercase so proprietary ones stand out. This is currently in progress.\n\n## Product and plan terminology\n\nThe way we refer to our product and services is: \"Mattermost sells subscription plans for both cloud and self-hosted deployment. Self-hosted deployments will need to upload a license file to activate the subscription.\"\n\nAll of our products are subscription plans. However, our self-hosted deployments also require a license file which is downloaded during the purchase process. This is the only difference between the two.\n\n**Note:** Currently our user purchase flow refers to \"Subscriptions\" for Cloud and \"Licenses\" for self-hosted. This will be adjusted to bring the messaging into alignment.\n",

        "title": "Documentation style guide",
        "content": "# Documentation style guide\n\nMattermost documentation is presented in various forms. We have product documentation, a Handbook, API guides, developer documentation, in-product copy, and microcopy. While there are different audiences for all these bodies of work, there are some guiding principles that should be applied to all our content.\n\nThe contents of this document can be applied to our product documentation, Handbook, developer documentation, and API guides. In-product copy and microcopy are covered in a separate guide.\n\nApply the style guide in the following situations:\n\n- When you create a new document.\n- When you convert a document from Markdown to reStructuredText.\n- When you revise a document.\n\nWhen you revise a document, apply the style guide rules to the part that you changed. If you have time to update the rest of the document, then do so. If the scope is significantly greater than you originally anticipated, then do what you can and what makes sense, and then create an [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/mattermost/docs/issues). Give the issue an appropriate title, such as *File XXX converted to .rst, but needs updating for style guide*.\n\n## General principles\n\n* **Always think about the audience that will be reading your writing.** Our audience comprises multiple personas, but we typically communicate with a technical audience and want to present Mattermost as being a friend of the practitioner in development, IT, and operations. It must be accurate and clear, and easy to navigate. \n* **The document structure should be consistent, as should the left-hand navigation sections.** For example, each of our tools' documentation includes a Getting Started section, an Overview section, and the section names are the same. This is as much for us as it is for our audience - consistency makes it easy for contributors to help us with content, and helps provide context and familiarity to readers.\n* **Write in the context of achievement.** The documentation should help Mattermost users and administrators achieve their goals. Write imperative sentences as much as possible. Imperative sentences begin with verbs and give instructions, information, and advice to help people install, administer, and use Mattermost with success. Use positive constructs as much as possible, but note that a negative construct can act as a warning that causes a reader to pay closer attention to the content, resulting in higher levels of accomplishment.\n* **Write to facilitate scanning.** Readers need to find information quickly. People don't read documentation as much as they scan it for solutions to their immediate problem. Writing and presentation styles that seem redundant in essays or other texts are often helpful to people scanning for information.\n\n## How we write things\n\nOne of our ongoing initiatives is to ensure our documentation is written in natural, clear language. We also focus on empathy and ensuring that we set our readers up for success. This section of the style guide is about content we reuse across our documentation. \n\nFor details about how we write UI text, naming conventions for CTAs, and writing with empathy, take a look at the [User Interface Text Guidelines](operations/research-and-development/product/technical-writing-team-handbook/user-interface-text-guidelines.md).\n\n### Plan and deloyment support details\n\nVisitors to Mattermost product documentation look for confirmation that a given feature is supported as part of their subscription plan and available in their self-hosted or Cloud-based deployment. This information is placed prominently at the top of every documentation page for easy scanning.\n\nPlan and deployment details can be added to new product documentation pages using the following RST syntax that uses a Sphinx ``include`` directive:\n\n```text\n.. include:: ../_static/badges/allplans-cloud-selfhosted.rst\n  :start-after: :nosearch:\n```\n\nThe ``include`` directive points to an RST file, and the file you specify is one of 12 templated files that cover all combinations of plan and deployment support available in the ``/_static/badges`` directory.\n\n**Note:** The ``:start-after`` line is important and shouldn't be omitted. The ``nosearch`` attribute is present in the templated RST files to instruct Sphinx not to return the templated files in search results. The include directive tells Sphinx to hide the ``nosearch`` text present in the templated RST files when publishing the page. \n\n### Tabbed content\n\nUsers visit product documentation looking for a clear, golden path to success. As software complexity grows, the paths to success can become less straightforward and dependent on customer-determined variables like operating systems, databases, and product release versions. \n\nOrganizing product documentation content in selectable tabs is an effective way to reduce clutter and reduce the amount of time readers spend looking for answers. Tabs can display more product information on a page without requiring the user to scroll through an entire page of content, and readers can reach relevant details with just a glance.\n\nContent can be formatted to display in tabs using the following RST syntax:\n\n```text\n.. tabs::\n\n\t.. tab:: Tab Name A\n\n\t\tTab text goes here. Users see this content when users visit this page.\n\n\t.. tab:: Tab Name B\n\n\t\tTab text goes here. The user must select this tab to see this content.\n\n\t.. tab:: Tab Name C\n\n\t\tTab text goes here. The user must select this tab to see this content\n```\n\nNote that tabbed content syntax applies only to RST source files and is not yet available within Markdown source files, and that spacing and indentation are important elements of the syntax. When previewing draft work, if tabbed content isn't displaying as expected, carefully review spacing and indentation.\n\nWhen presenting content in tabs, tab names must be exactly the same across all instances, for consistency.\n\n\"From Mattermost version 6.0...\" vs \"In Mattermost versions up to v5.39\"\n\n### Return Mattermost configuration settings in search results\n\nThe product documentation site returns and prioritizes configuration settings in search results. This is achieved by adding metadata to each configuration settting section in the form of a directive and its options. Please see https://github.com/mattermost/docs/pull/5911 for comprehensive details on how this search engine was designed and implemented in the source code via Sphinx.\n\nThis metadata is positioned directly **above** each section header on each config setting docs page, and will look something like this:\n\n```rst\n.. config:setting:: web-useletsencrypt\n  :displayname: Use Let's Encrypt (Web Server)\n  :systemconsole: Environment > Web Server\n  :configjson: .ServiceSettings.UseLetsEncrypt\n  :environment: MM_SERVICESETTINGS_USELETSENCRYPT\n  :description: Enable the automatic retrieval of certificates from Let\u2019s Encrypt.\n```\n\nThe directive itself needs a unique identifier, such as ``web-useletsencrypt``. The directive's options, including ``displayname``, ``systemconsole``, ``configjson``, ``environment``, and ``description`` essentially duplicates the config setting details. We're doing this so that the config setting details readers want show up on the search results page.\n\nNote that we're currently manually duplicating config details (in this directive metadata as well as the docs content itself), but we'll automate this in the future to ensure only one source of data needs to be maintained. (This manual step is a stepping stone towards that automation approach).\n\nThe setting directive supports the following options:\n\n``displayname``: User-friendly text that is displayed as the name of a config setting\n``systemconsole``: The location in the System Console of the config setting\n``configjson``: The config.json name of the config setting\n``environment``: The environment variable for the config setting\n``description``: Description of the config setting; can be any length\n\nNote: the ``description`` option also supports basic reStructuredText markup but doesn't support nested directives within that option.\n\nWhen documenting a new Mattermost configuration setting, ensure you add and populate the metadata in the source file to ensure the config setting can be returned in search results. Missing metadata will result in missing search results. The configuration settings source files contain many examples to work from.\n\n## Writing style\n\nWhile we don't strictly follow a specific Style Guide, we've based our Style Guide on the Chicago Manual of Style for the most part. We also borrow conventions from the AP Style Guide. In cases where we have a blend of the two, we've provided references and explanations.\n\nWe try to keep the following top of mind when creating content:\n\n* Work on the premise that \"Every page is page 1\", as a large portion of users access our documentation directly from a Google search\n* Add a summary to the top of each page for readers to be able to quickly assess the content for suitability\n* Break long sections into smaller, easily digestable subpages\n* Have at most one key point or action per paragraph\n* Refer to one thing or idea with the same word throughout the page\n* Use ordered lists or bullets where appropriate, as they are generally easier to read than long blocks of text\n* Minimize content so it can be found and remembered. Keep pages short, modular, and focused on a single topic\n\nMattermost documentation is read and used in many countries/regions and cultures. For this reason, you must consider cultural differences on a global scale. Names, places, events, and actions should be chosen as carefully as possible to avoid misunderstanding.\n\nAlso remember that English isn't the primary language of many readers of the documentation. Keep the following advice in mind when writing:\n\n* Choose words with one or very few meanings.\n* Use simple verb forms in writing. Most verbs in the simple form are likely to have an equivalent in another language.\n* Avoid jargon and slang words.\n* Limit difficult words to technical terms where their use is unavoidable.\n* Always make sure that your spelling is correct.\n\n### Language\n\nWe write in English and use American English. This means we use \"z\" instead of \"s\" in words like \"organization\". It helps to set your browser and editing tool to use a US dictionary so that if you inadvertently use British English, you'll be alerted. Currently, our documentation is not localized, but many other aspects of Mattermost's tools, such as in-product copy, are.\n\nOne very important rule is to avoid constructs where you are forced to write either _he_ or _she_, or _his_ or _her_. You can use _they_ or _their_ as singular forms instead. As we write in first-person, we generally refer to _you_, _users_, _them_.\n\n### Numbers\n\nWe borrow from both AP and Chicago in this instance:\n\nSpell out numbers when the number is the first word in a sentence or is less than or equal to ten \\(i.e. one to nine\\), otherwise use figures \\(i.e., 10 upwards\\). Use commas to make long number strings easier to read.\n\nAvoid\n  3 cows ran for 6 kilometers when they saw 2300097 mosquitoes chasing them.\n\nPreferred\n  Three cows ran for six kilometers when they saw 2,300,097 mosquitoes chasing them.\n\n[Helpful overview](https://www.grammarbook.com/numbers/numbers.asp):\n\n\"In terms of numbering, policies and philosophies vary from medium to medium. America's two most influential style and usage guides have different approaches: The Associated Press Stylebook recommends spelling out the numbers zero through nine and using numerals thereafter\u2014until one million is reached. Here are four examples of how to write numbers above 999,999 in AP style: 1 million; 20 million; 20,040,086; 2.7 trillion.\n\nThe Chicago Manual of Style recommends spelling out the numbers zero through one hundred and using figures thereafter \u2014 except for whole numbers used in combination with hundred, thousand, hundred thousand, million, billion, and beyond (e.g., two hundred; twenty-eight thousand; three hundred thousand; one million). In Chicago style we would write four hundred, eight thousand, and twenty million with no numerals. Chicago style would require numerals for 401; 8,012; and 20,040,086.\"\n\n### Commas\n\nWe use the Oxford \\(serial\\) comma in our documentation.\n\nAvoid\n  The cows ran from wolves, coyotes and mosquitoes.\n\nPreferred\n  The cows ran from wolves, coyotes, and mosquitoes.\n\n### Capitalization\n\n#### Document titles\n\nWe use sentence case for document names/titles. A document title is usually called an H1 heading and is either denoted by `#` in Markdown or `======` in reStructuredText. The title appears in the left-hand navigation and at the top of the table of contents. Use a title that accurately reflects the content of the document. People scan the table of contents looking for answers; it's often faster than using the built-in search engine.\n\n**Use sentence case for document titles \\(e.g. \"This is an article about Documentation\"\\). Where a word/title/name is lowercase, retain that casing in the title \\(e.g. \"This article covers the mmctl Tool\"\\).**\n\nInstead of *\"Deployment guide for organizations\"* we write *\"Deployment guide for organizations\"*\n\n#### Section titles and headings\n\nWe use sentence case for section titles and headings. Each section should have a heading, and the heading should relate to the content of the section. A section heading is not required if you have only one section.\n\nA section title is usually called H2, H3, H4, etc. Section headings are usually not clickable, but instead have formatting like bold or italics. Section titles are denoted by `#` in Markdown, with the number of #s indicating what level of heading is being used (i.e., `##` for H2, `###`for H3 etc). In reStructuredText the heading rules are slightly more complicated in terms of formatting, as we use Sphinx to process our documentation. You can read more about this in the [using reStructuredText markup](using-restructuredtext-markup-rst) section.\n\n**Use sentence case for the section heading \\(e.g. \"This section is about types of headings\"\\) except where a word/phrase is a proper noun \\(e.g. \"Mattermost\"\\), the name of a country/region \\(e.g. \"The United States of America\"\\), and so on.**\n\n**Title example**\n\nInstead of *\"Writing Guidelines for Editors\"* we write *\"Writing guidelines for editors\"*\n\n### Person\n\nUse the second person and avoid the first person.\n\nAvoid\n  We'll view the status in the *Status* pane.\n\nPreferred\n  View the status in the *Status* pane.\n\n### Voice\n\nUse active voice in preference to passive voice. Active voice has the subject of a sentence doing the action. In passive voice, the subject has an action done to it.\n\nAvoid\n  The *Status* pane will be opened by the system.\n\nPreferred\n  The system opens the *Status* pane.\n\n### Tense\n\nUse the present tense.\n\nAvoid\n  Sharing this link will let other users view the linked message.\n\nPreferred\n  Sharing this link lets other users view the linked message.\n\n## Terminology Guide\n\nThroughout Mattermost documentation, you\u2019ll see the below terms mentioned and used. Their definitions and reason for usage are defined below.\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th style=\"text-align:left\">Terms</th>\n      <th style=\"text-align:left\">Description</th>\n      <th style=\"text-align:left\">Usage</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">Mattermost</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">Used to refer to <a href=\"https://mattermost.com/about-us/\">Mattermost</a> the\n        company and <a href=\"https://mattermost.com/product/\">Mattermost</a> the\n        product.</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">\n        <p>Mattermost is an open-source, self-hosted messaging platform with unlimited\n          file sharing, search, and integrations</p>\n        <p>Configure Mattermost on your server</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">installation</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">Refers to an on-premises Mattermost environment comprising hardware\n        (server/s), database, filestore, etc., which hosts the required files to\n        run Mattermost.</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">Your Mattermost installation includes physical servers</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">deployment</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">Used to refer to making a new installation widely accessible.

Use *may* only to give permission to do something.\n\n- downtime\n\t- Use as one word *downtime*, not *down time*.\n\n- emoji, emojis\n\t- Use *emojis* as the plural form of *emoji*.\n\n- login, log in, log into\n\t- Use *login* as a noun or adjective, and *log in* and *log into* as verbs. For example: *Log into the Mattermost server using your System Admin login credentials.*\n\n- setup, set up\n\t- Use *setup* as a noun or adjective, and *set up* as a verb. For example: *Set up your operating system as described in the Ubuntu documentation.*\n\n- sign-in, sign in, and sign into\n\t- Use *sign-in* as a noun or adjective, and *sign in* and *sign into* as verbs. For example: *Sign into your Mattermost account using the sign-in credentials that were sent to you.*\n\n- Single Sign-on\n\t- Single Sign-on is abbreviated as SSO. When using the long form in a heading with title case, it's *Single Sign-on*.\n\n## Gender-neutral Text\n\nAvoid constructs where you're forced to write either *he or she* or *his or her*. You can use *they* or *their* as singular forms instead.\n\nPreferred\n  The community manager monitors the forum for well-written questions and answers, and posts them to the Contributors channel.\nAvoid\n  The community manager posts questions and answers that they think are well-written.\nDo not use\n  The community manager posts questions and answers that he or she thinks are well-written.\n\n## Using ReStructuredText markup \\(rst\\)\n\nThe reStructuredText specification allows for a certain degree of flexibility in markup to achieve your goals. For example, you can use any one of more than a dozen characters for section title underlines, and you have the option of using an overline in addition to an underline.\n\nThe majority of Mattermost technical documentation is written in `.rst`. The examples below describe the conventions we use when writing in `.rst`.\n\n### Page titles\n\nUnderline page titles using `=`, with no overline. Underlines should be as long as the title text.\n\n```text\n  Document Title\n  ==============\n```\n\n### Section titles\n\nUnderline using `-` for section titles.\n\n```text\n  Section title\n  -------------\n```\n\nUnderline subsections using `~` for the first subsection level, and `^` for the second subsection level.\n\n```text\n  Subsection one\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n  Subsection two\n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n```\n\n### Table of contents\n\nInsert a table of contents into a document using the following format:\n\n```text\n  .. contents::\n      :backlinks: top\n```\n\n### Text formatting\n\nUse highlighting of text to visually set off words and phrases that are important to readers. Content that should be highlighted includes file names, UI controls, and window titles. The following table has a comprehensive list with examples.\n\n| Text | Format | Example |  |\n| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |\n| Commands | `````monospace`````  | \"At the command line, type `sudo apt-get install nginx`.\" |  |\n| Directory name | `````monospace`````  | `/opt/mattermost` |  |\n| File name | `````monospace`````  | `config.py` |  |\n| Inline code | `````monospace`````  | `fmt.Printf(\"2 times %d = %d\\n\", x, y )` |  |\n| Keystrokes | `````monospace`````  | \"Type `https://` in the string field.\" |  |\n| Screen output | `````monospace`````  | See :ref:`literal-blocks` for an example. |  |\n| Parameter values | `````monospace`````  | \"Set the _auto-config_ parameter to `false`\" |  |\n| Field names | `**bold**` | If the field has punctuation, include that in the formatting. For example \"Enter the URL in the **Enter URL:** field.\" |  |\n| Clickable control | `**bold**` | \"Click **File &gt; Save**.\" |  |\n| UI elements | `**bold**` | \"Open **Main Menu &gt; Account Settings**.\" |  |\n| Dialog boxes | `**bold**` | \"The **Create Thread** window opens.\" |  |\n| Citations | `*italic*` | \"Read the book _Clean Code_ by Robert Martin.\" |  |\n| User account names | `*italic*` | \"Log in to the _mysql_ account.\" |  |\n| Parameter names | `*italic*` | \"Set the _auto-config_ parameter to `false`\" |  |\n| Keyboard buttons | Key1+Key2 | \"Press CTRL+U to upload a file.\" |  |\n| Placeholder field | {placeholder} | \"Use the URL in the form of {hostname}.mattermost.com/{team}.\" |  |\n\n### Bullet lists\n\nFor bullet lists and sublists, use `-` before the list item.\n\n```text\n  - list item one\n  - list item two\n    - sublist item one\n    - sublist item two\n  - list item three\n```\n\n### Numbered lists and procedure steps\n\nCreate numbered lists and procedure steps using numbers for the top-level list and lowercase alpha characters for the first nested list.\n\n```text\n  1. This is item one.\n  2. This is item two.\n\n    a. This is nested item one.\n    b. This is nested item two.\n\n  3. This is item three.\n```\n\n### Name-value groups\n\nUse a name-value group instead of a hand-created list.\n\nA name-value group is typically a group of terms and their corresponding definitions, but can also be questions and answers, topics and values, or other name-value groups. In HTML output, a name-value group is represented as a definition list.\n\nPreferred\n  Total Users\n    The total number of active accounts created on your system. Excludes inactive accounts.\n  Total Teams\n    The total number of teams created on your system.\n\nAvoid\n  **Total Users:** The total number of active accounts created on your system. Excludes inactive accounts.\n\n  **Total Teams:**  The total number of teams created on your system.\n\nTo create a name-value group such as a definition list, type the term on a line by itself. On the next line, indent the definition.\n\n```\n  Total users\n    The total number of active accounts created on your system.

External link URLs are automatically rendered as links in Sphinx (when formatted correctly). Where possible, incorporate hyperlinks within the text of a sentence by lowercasing the link text. \n\nExternal hyperlinks within a sentence can be created using the following formatting:\n\n```text\n`Link display text <URL-of-website>`__\n\nFor example:\n  `Mattermost Product Pricing <https://www.mattermost.com/pricing/>`__\n```\n\nNote the full URL, the opening and closing single quotes, and the two underline characters at the end of the link syntax.\n\nThe link above renders as: [Mattermost Product Pricing](https://www.mattermost.com/pricing).\n\n#### Internal links\n\nInternal links take readers to a page within the Mattermost product documentation. When creating links to pages in the product documentation, always use a relative URL instead of an external (or absolute) link. A link with an absolute URL is not as flexible as a relative URL. Relative URLs don't break when the documentation is moved to another host, or if the documentation is hosted on a server that's behind a firewall without access to the Internet.\n\n##### Link to another page in the same section\n\nTo create a link to another documentation page within the same section of the product documentation, use the following formatting:\n\n```text \n:doc:`Link display text </folder/filename>`\n\nFor example, when you want to add a link on a Channels page to another Channels page:\n  See the :doc:`channel preferences </channels/set-channel-preferences>` documentation for details.\n```\n\nNotes: \n\n- The file extension is not part of the syntax, and that two underline characters are missing. Sphinx uses the title of the document as the link text.\n- If you're looking to create an internal link to a section on another page (as opposed to creating a link to the top of a page in general), the syntax above won't work. Docs is investigating further to identify a solution.\n\nIn Sphinx, references are constructed using roles, and roles point to locations in the documentation set. The two roles that are relevant in Mattermost documentation are the `:doc:` role and the `:ref:` role. In both cases, the HTML output is a relative URL for the target location.\n\n- The `:doc:` role is used for creating relative links to other documents. \n- The `:ref:` role is used for creating relative links to arbitrary locations within the documentation set, including within the same document, based on a unique identifier specified at the top of a source file. The `:ref:` role is a two-part construct. One part is the link itself, and the other part is the target on the source page.\n\n  - The link itself is specified as: :ref:`arbitrary-text-label`\n  - The target is added as the first line of the source page (preceding the title): `.. _arbitrary-text-label:`\n\n##### Link to a section heading on the current page\n\nTo create a link to a section heading on the current page, identify the unique anchor ID assigned to the section title in a local build, a remote build, or within production, then use the following formatting:\n\n```text\n`Link display text <#uniqueanchorID>`__\n```\n\n### Bullet lists\n```\n\nTo generate a link to the section, use the `:ref:` role as follows:\n\n```text\n  For more information about bullet lists, see :ref:`arbitrary-text-label`.\n```\n\nThe Sphinx processor creates a relative link to the section, and uses the section title as the link text. On output, the link looks like this: \"For more information about bullet lists, see :ref:`arbitrary-text-label`.\"\n\n### Images\n\nUse the following construct to insert an image:\n\n```text\n  .. image:: ../images/choices.png\n```\n\nYou should use `alt` tag for all images.\n\nYou can also add the following image options: `height`, `width`, `scale`, `align`, and `target`.\n\n```text\n  .. image:: ../images/choices.png\n    :alt: The choices that you can make.\n    :height: 100px //number refers to pixels\n    :width: 200px //number refers to pixels\n    :align: left //left, right or middle\n    :scale: 50 //number is a percentage\n```\n\nInserting an inline image is a bit more complicated. It's a two-part construct that consists of a label and the image directive. Surround the label text with vertical bars, the `|` character.\n\n```text\n  Some of the emoji that you can use are |emoji|.\n```\n\nThen insert the following image directive at the bottom of the document:\n\n```text\n  .. |emoji| image:: ../images/emoji.png\n    :alt: Some of the emoji that you can use.\n    :align: middle\n```\n\n### Literal blocks\n\nTo use a literal block with no syntax highlighting, use the Sphinx code-block directive with the language set to `none`.\n\n```text\n  .. code-block:: none\n```\n\n### Code blocks with syntax highlighting\n\nTo create a code block with syntax highlighting, use the Sphinx code-block directive with the language set to the language that you want highlighted. [Many languages are available](http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/), but in Mattermost documentation the most likely ones are as follows:\n\n```text\n- go\n- rest\n- html\n- javascript\n- coffee\n- bash\n```\n\nThe following example is a block of Go code.\n\n```text\n  .. code-block:: go\n    :linenos:\n\n    newPassword := props[\"new_password\"]\n      if err := utils.IsPasswordValid(newPassword); err != nil {\n          c.Err = err\n          return\n      }\n```\n\n### Archive documentation pages\n\nWhen a documentation page is no longer needed, that page should be archived. Archiving a page prevents that page from being included in the build altogether.\n\nTo archive a documentation page:\n\n1. Identify where you want the reader to go instead of the page that's being archived.\n2. Move the source file to the `/source/archive` folder.\n3. (RST files only) In the file you just moved to the `archive` folder, add `:nosearch:` at the top of the file (above any anchor identifier, title, or code comment present in the file). This prevents the documentation page from being returned in search results.\n4. Add a redirect to the `conf.py` file from the archived page to a new destination page.\n5. Search for and replace any links across the documentation set to the archived file, including LHS, landing pages, and paragraph-level links.\n\n### Silence `not in toctree` build warnings\n\nWhen working and building the documentation locally in a development environment, writers can review build warnings and errors in the `/build/warnings.log` file. Build warnings and errors can include (but aren't limited to):\n\n- Broken links\n- Documentation pages missing from the LHS unintentionally\n- Syntax and formatting issues\n\nAs part of monthly documentation release cycles, technical writers review and take action on build warnings and errors reported.\n\nTo silence warnings for RST documentation pages that are missing from the LHS unintentionally, add `:orphan:` at the top of the file (above any anchor identifier, title, or code comment present in the file). The next time the product documentation is built, that warning is silenced. (A documentation page can contain both `:nosearch:` and `:orphan:`, and these two directives can be listed in either order).\n\n### Stop a documentation page from being returned in search results\n\nSome documentation pages should never be returned in search results, including:\n\n- Archived pages.\n- Unofficial documentation pages. All unofficial product documentation should live within the [Mattermost Discussion Forums](https://forum.mattermost.com/c/docs/37).\n- Pages that exist only to be included on other documentation pages. These pages often don't provide enough context to be useful if accessed directly.\n\nTo prevent RST documentation pages from being returned in search results, add `:nosearch:` at the top of the file (above any anchor identifier, title, or code comment present in the file. (A documentation page can contain both `:nosearch:` and `:orphan:`, and these two directives can be listed in either order).\n\n### Add code comments\n\nAdding code comments to documentation source files helps contributors understand why specific decisions were made or what additional knowledge is required when working within a specific source file. For example, if a documentation page isn't accessible in the LHS by design, adding a code comment in the source file helps future contributors understand that it was an intentional decision.\n\nIn RST files, format code comments as `.. Code comment text here`. Code comment text isn't visible to users in the published product documentation.\n\n### Embed videos in product documentation\n\nTo accommodate the many ways that people learn, its helpful to include visual elements, such as videos, in the Mattermost product documentation. The process and code needed to embed a video on a documentation page differs depending on how the video is hosted. Mattermost typically hosts product videos through either YouTube or Wistia (and Wistia is preferrable over YouTube, when available, because viewers aren't subject to ads).\n\n#### Embed a YouTube video on a page\n\n1. Obtain the YouTube video link.\n2. The code to embed the video consists of two parts: a paragraph-level link and iframe code. Copy the code below into the documentation source file, then update the introduction text and replace the `YouTubeVideoLink`.\n\n```text\nSee our `tutorial video on YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YouTubeVideoLink>`_. \n\n.. raw:: html\n\n   <div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 50%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\">\n      <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YouTubeVideoLink\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 95%;\"></iframe>\n   </div>\n```\n\n#### Embed a Wistia video on a page\n\n1. Request the [Wistia inline embedded code snippet](https://wistia.com/support/embed-and-share/media-on-your-website#inline-embeds) from the video producer. \n2. Copy and paste the code you receive into the documentation source file. The code you receive will look similar to the following example:\n\n```text\n.. raw:: html\n\n  <script src=\"https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/5gjgi10rr0.jsonp\" async></script><script src=\"https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js\" async></script><div class=\"wistia_responsive_padding\" style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><div class=\"wistia_responsive_wrapper\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;\"><div class=\"wistia_embed wistia_async_5gjgi10rr0 videoFoam=true\" style=\"height:100%;position:relative;width:100%\"><div class=\"wistia_swatch\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;\"><img src=\"https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/5gjgi10rr0/swatch\" style=\"filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%;\" alt=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" onload=\"this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;\" /></div></div></div></div>\n```\n\n### Plan and deployment badges\n\nMost Mattermost product documentation pages feature plan and deployment badges located directly under the page title or section title. These badges indicate:\n\n- The Mattermost subscription plans that support the feature or function. Options include **All Plans**, **Enterprise**, and **Professional**.\n- The Mattermost deployment approach that supports the feature or function. Options include **Cloud** or **Self-hosted**.\n\nThese badges are defined on a per-page basis as inline images located close to the top of the source file. Please be careful to avoid making changes to the badge code when modifing other aspects of the documentation page.\n\nNote that, longer term, it would be ideal to replace the current badge implementation with a more programmatic solution where the badges are defined once and simply referenced across all applicable documentation pages.\n\n## Using Markdown\n\nThe majority of Mattermost technical documentation is written in `.rst` format. However, there are some instances where Markdown is used, for example the Mattermost Handbook. You can read more about using Markdown in the [Formatting Text](https://docs.mattermost.com/messaging/formatting-text.html) section of the Mattermost product documentation.\n\n## Manage and resolve merge conflicts\n\nMattermost hosts the source code and content of its technical documentation in GitHub repositories. Documentation is updated by submitting pull requests on GitHub. After a pull request is reviewed and approved, it is usually merged into the master branch without further changes. Sometimes, however, conflicts between the files being updated and the master branch must be resolved.\n\nGitHub flags conflicting regions of a file with these characters: `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`. The block of text between `<<<<<<<` and `=======` is the content that the pull request is attempting to merge. The block of text between `=======` and `>>>>>>>` is the block of text from the master branch that conflicts with the content in the pull request. Resolving a conflict may require removing content that has been updated in the pull request, or manually integrating text from the pull request. **The flag characters must also be removed.**\n\nAfter resolving the conflicts in a given file, mark it as resolved in GitHub. All conflicts must be resolved for the merge to proceed.\n\nThe image below shows a section of a file with a merge conflict:\n\n[](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74422101/211895979-255e4988-82de-40e9-97dd-5da97b1d98c9.png)\n\nThe lines between `<<<<<<< issue-5951-authentication-oauth-ms` and `=======` are from the pull request. The lines between `=======` and `>>>>>>> master` are from the master branch. In this case, metadata had been added to the same region of the file that was edited in the pull request. In order to resolve the conflict, the text from the pull request and the metadata were kept, while part of the text from the master branch was removed.",
        "html": "<h1>Documentation style guide</h1>\n<p>Mattermost documentation is presented in various forms. We have product documentation, a Handbook, API guides, developer documentation, in-product copy, and microcopy. While there are different audiences for all these bodies of work, there are some guiding principles that should be applied to all our content.</p>\n<p>The contents of this document can be applied to our product documentation, Handbook, developer documentation, and API guides. In-product copy and microcopy are covered in a separate guide.</p>\n<p>Apply the style guide in the following situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you create a new document.</li>\n<li>When you convert a document from Markdown to reStructuredText.</li>\n<li>When you revise a document.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you revise a document, apply the style guide rules to the part that you changed. If you have time to update the rest of the document, then do so. If the scope is significantly greater than you originally anticipated, then do what you can and what makes sense, and then create an <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/docs/issues\">issue in GitHub</a>. Give the issue an appropriate title, such as <em>File XXX converted to .rst, but needs updating for style guide</em>.</p>\n<h2>General principles</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Always think about the audience that will be reading your writing.</strong> Our audience comprises multiple personas, but we typically communicate with a technical audience and want to present Mattermost as being a friend of the practitioner in development, IT, and operations. It must be accurate and clear, and easy to navigate. </li>\n<li><strong>The document structure should be consistent, as should the left-hand navigation sections.</strong> For example, each of our tools' documentation includes a Getting Started section, an Overview section, and the section names are the same. This is as much for us as it is for our audience - consistency makes it easy for contributors to help us with content, and helps provide context and familiarity to readers.</li>\n<li><strong>Write in the context of achievement.</strong> The documentation should help Mattermost users and administrators achieve their goals. Write imperative sentences as much as possible. Imperative sentences begin with verbs and give instructions, information, and advice to help people install, administer, and use Mattermost with success. Use positive constructs as much as possible, but note that a negative construct can act as a warning that causes a reader to pay closer attention to the content, resulting in higher levels of accomplishment.</li>\n<li><strong>Write to facilitate scanning.</strong> Readers need to find information quickly. People don't read documentation as much as they scan it for solutions to their immediate problem. Writing and presentation styles that seem redundant in essays or other texts are often helpful to people scanning for information.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How we write things</h2>\n<p>One of our ongoing initiatives is to ensure our documentation is written in natural, clear language. We also focus on empathy and ensuring that we set our readers up for success. This section of the style guide is about content we reuse across our documentation. </p>\n<p>For details about how we write UI text, naming conventions for CTAs, and writing with empathy, take a look at the <a href=\"operations/research-and-development/product/technical-writing-team-handbook/user-interface-text-guidelines.md\">User Interface Text Guidelines</a>.</p>\n<h3>Plan and deloyment support details</h3>\n<p>Visitors to Mattermost product documentation look for confirmation that a given feature is supported as part of their subscription plan and available in their self-hosted or Cloud-based deployment. This information is placed prominently at the top of every documentation page for easy scanning.</p>\n<p>Plan and deployment details can be added to new product documentation pages using the following RST syntax that uses a Sphinx <code>include</code> directive:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">.. include:: ../_static/badges/allplans-cloud-selfhosted.rst\n  :start-after: :nosearch:\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>include</code> directive points to an RST file, and the file you specify is one of 12 templated files that cover all combinations of plan and deployment support available in the <code>/_static/badges</code> directory.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>:start-after</code> line is important and shouldn't be omitted. The <code>nosearch</code> attribute is present in the templated RST files to instruct Sphinx not to return the templated files in search results. The include directive tells Sphinx to hide the <code>nosearch</code> text present in the templated RST files when publishing the page. </p>\n<h3>Tabbed content</h3>\n<p>Users visit product documentation looking for a clear, golden path to success. As software complexity grows, the paths to success can become less straightforward and dependent on customer-determined variables like operating systems, databases, and product release versions. </p>\n<p>Organizing product documentation content in selectable tabs is an effective way to reduce clutter and reduce the amount of time readers spend looking for answers. Tabs can display more product information on a page without requiring the user to scroll through an entire page of content, and readers can reach relevant details with just a glance.</p>\n<p>Content can be formatted to display in tabs using the following RST syntax:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">.. tabs::\n\n    .. tab:: Tab Name A\n\n        Tab text goes here. Users see this content when users visit this page.\n\n    .. tab:: Tab Name B\n\n        Tab text goes here. The user must select this tab to see this content.\n\n    .. tab:: Tab Name C\n\n        Tab text goes here. The user must select this tab to see this content\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that tabbed content syntax applies only to RST source files and is not yet available within Markdown source files, and that spacing and indentation are important elements of the syntax. When previewing draft work, if tabbed content isn't displaying as expected, carefully review spacing and indentation.</p>\n<p>When presenting content in tabs, tab names must be exactly the same across all instances, for consistency.</p>\n<p>\"From Mattermost version 6.0...\" vs \"In Mattermost versions up to v5.39\"</p>\n<h3>Return Mattermost configuration settings in search results</h3>\n<p>The product documentation site returns and prioritizes configuration settings in search results. This is achieved by adding metadata to each configuration settting section in the form of a directive and its options. Please see https://github.com/mattermost/docs/pull/5911 for comprehensive details on how this search engine was designed and implemented in the source code via Sphinx.</p>\n<p>This metadata is positioned directly <strong>above</strong> each section header on each config setting docs page, and will look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rst\">.. config:setting:: web-useletsencrypt\n  :displayname: Use Let's Encrypt (Web Server)\n  :systemconsole: Environment &gt; Web Server\n  :configjson: .ServiceSettings.UseLetsEncrypt\n  :environment: MM_SERVICESETTINGS_USELETSENCRYPT\n  :description: Enable the automatic retrieval of certificates from Let\u2019s Encrypt.\n</code></pre>\n<p>The directive itself needs a unique identifier, such as <code>web-useletsencrypt</code>. The directive's options, including <code>displayname</code>, <code>systemconsole</code>, <code>configjson</code>, <code>environment</code>, and <code>description</code> essentially duplicates the config setting details. We're doing this so that the config setting details readers want show up on the search results page.</p>\n<p>Note that we're currently manually duplicating config details (in this directive metadata as well as the docs content itself), but we'll automate this in the future to ensure only one source of data needs to be maintained. (This manual step is a stepping stone towards that automation approach).</p>\n<p>The setting directive supports the following options:</p>\n<p><code>displayname</code>: User-friendly text that is displayed as the name of a config setting\n<code>systemconsole</code>: The location in the System Console of the config setting\n<code>configjson</code>: The config.json name of the config setting\n<code>environment</code>: The environment variable for the config setting\n<code>description</code>: Description of the config setting; can be any length</p>\n<p>Note: the <code>description</code> option also supports basic reStructuredText markup but doesn't support nested directives within that option.</p>\n<p>When documenting a new Mattermost configuration setting, ensure you add and populate the metadata in the source file to ensure the config setting can be returned in search results. Missing metadata will result in missing search results. The configuration settings source files contain many examples to work from.</p>\n<h2>Writing style</h2>\n<p>While we don't strictly follow a specific Style Guide, we've based our Style Guide on the Chicago Manual of Style for the most part. We also borrow conventions from the AP Style Guide. In cases where we have a blend of the two, we've provided references and explanations.</p>\n<p>We try to keep the following top of mind when creating content:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work on the premise that \"Every page is page 1\", as a large portion of users access our documentation directly from a Google search</li>\n<li>Add a summary to the top of each page for readers to be able to quickly assess the content for suitability</li>\n<li>Break long sections into smaller, easily digestable subpages</li>\n<li>Have at most one key point or action per paragraph</li>\n<li>Refer to one thing or idea with the same word throughout the page</li>\n<li>Use ordered lists or bullets where appropriate, as they are generally easier to read than long blocks of text</li>\n<li>Minimize content so it can be found and remembered. Keep pages short, modular, and focused on a single topic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mattermost documentation is read and used in many countries/regions and cultures. For this reason, you must consider cultural differences on a global scale. Names, places, events, and actions should be chosen as carefully as possible to avoid misunderstanding.</p>\n<p>Also remember that English isn't the primary language of many readers of the documentation. Keep the following advice in mind when writing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose words with one or very few meanings.</li>\n<li>Use simple verb forms in writing. Most verbs in the simple form are likely to have an equivalent in another language.</li>\n<li>Avoid jargon and slang words.</li>\n<li>Limit difficult words to technical terms where their use is unavoidable.</li>\n<li>Always make sure that your spelling is correct.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Language</h3>\n<p>We write in English and use American English. This means we use \"z\" instead of \"s\" in words like \"organization\". It helps to set your browser and editing tool to use a US dictionary so that if you inadvertently use British English, you'll be alerted. Currently, our documentation is not localized, but many other aspects of Mattermost's tools, such as in-product copy, are.</p>\n<p>One very important rule is to avoid constructs where you are forced to write either <em>he</em> or <em>she</em>, or <em>his</em> or <em>her</em>. You can use <em>they</em> or <em>their</em> as singular forms instead. As we write in first-person, we generally refer to <em>you</em>, <em>users</em>, <em>them</em>.</p>\n<h3>Numbers</h3>\n<p>We borrow from both AP and Chicago in this instance:</p>\n<p>Spell out numbers when the number is the first word in a sentence or is less than or equal to ten (i.e. one to nine), otherwise use figures (i.e., 10 upwards). Use commas to make long number strings easier to read.</p>\n<p>Avoid\n  3 cows ran for 6 kilometers when they saw 2300097 mosquitoes chasing them.</p>\n<p>Preferred\n  Three cows ran for six kilometers when they saw 2,300,097 mosquitoes chasing them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.grammarbook.com/numbers/numbers.asp\">Helpful overview</a>:</p>\n<p>\"In terms of numbering, policies and philosophies vary from medium to medium. America's two most influential style and usage guides have different approaches: The Associated Press Stylebook recommends spelling out the numbers zero through nine and using numerals thereafter\u2014until one million is reached. Here are four examples of how to write numbers above 999,999 in AP style: 1 million; 20 million; 20,040,086; 2.7 trillion.</p>\n<p>The Chicago Manual of Style recommends spelling out the numbers zero through one hundred and using figures thereafter \u2014 except for whole numbers used in combination with hundred, thousand, hundred thousand, million, billion, and beyond (e.g., two hundred; twenty-eight thousand; three hundred thousand; one million). In Chicago style we would write four hundred, eight thousand, and twenty million with no numerals. Chicago style would require numerals for 401; 8,012; and 20,040,086.\"</p>\n<h3>Commas</h3>\n<p>We use the Oxford (serial) comma in our documentation.</p>\n<p>Avoid\n  The cows ran from wolves, coyotes and mosquitoes.</p>\n<p>Preferred\n  The cows ran from wolves, coyotes, and mosquitoes.</p>\n<h3>Capitalization</h3>\n<h4>Document titles</h4>\n<p>We use sentence case for document names/titles. A document title is usually called an H1 heading and is either denoted by <code>#</code> in Markdown or <code>======</code> in reStructuredText. The title appears in the left-hand navigation and at the top of the table of contents. Use a title that accurately reflects the content of the document. People scan the table of contents looking for answers; it's often faster than using the built-in search engine.</p>\n<p><strong>Use sentence case for document titles (e.g. \"This is an article about Documentation\"). Where a word/title/name is lowercase, retain that casing in the title (e.g. \"This article covers the mmctl Tool\").</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of <em>\"Deployment guide for organizations\"</em> we write <em>\"Deployment guide for organizations\"</em></p>\n<h4>Section titles and headings</h4>\n<p>We use sentence case for section titles and headings. Each section should have a heading, and the heading should relate to the content of the section. A section heading is not required if you have only one section.</p>\n<p>A section title is usually called H2, H3, H4, etc. Section headings are usually not clickable, but instead have formatting like bold or italics. Section titles are denoted by <code>#</code> in Markdown, with the number of #s indicating what level of heading is being used (i.e., <code>##</code> for H2, <code>###</code>for H3 etc). In reStructuredText the heading rules are slightly more complicated in terms of formatting, as we use Sphinx to process our documentation. You can read more about this in the <a href=\"using-restructuredtext-markup-rst\">using reStructuredText markup</a> section.</p>\n<p><strong>Use sentence case for the section heading (e.g. \"This section is about types of headings\") except where a word/phrase is a proper noun (e.g. \"Mattermost\"), the name of a country/region (e.g. \"The United States of America\"), and so on.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Title example</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of <em>\"Writing Guidelines for Editors\"</em> we write <em>\"Writing guidelines for editors\"</em></p>\n<h3>Person</h3>\n<p>Use the second person and avoid the first person.</p>\n<p>Avoid\n  We'll view the status in the <em>Status</em> pane.</p>\n<p>Preferred\n  View the status in the <em>Status</em> pane.</p>\n<h3>Voice</h3>\n<p>Use active voice in preference to passive voice.

To avoid ambiguity, use <em>can</em> or <em>might</em> instead of <em>may</em>. Use <em>can</em> to mean <em>capable of</em> and <em>might</em> to mean that something is possible. Use <em>may</em> only to give permission to do something.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>downtime</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use as one word <em>downtime</em>, not <em>down time</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>emoji, emojis</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <em>emojis</em> as the plural form of <em>emoji</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>login, log in, log into</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <em>login</em> as a noun or adjective, and <em>log in</em> and <em>log into</em> as verbs.

You can use <em>they</em> or <em>their</em> as singular forms instead.</p>\n<p>Preferred\n  The community manager monitors the forum for well-written questions and answers, and posts them to the Contributors channel.\nAvoid\n  The community manager posts questions and answers that they think are well-written.\nDo not use\n  The community manager posts questions and answers that he or she thinks are well-written.</p>\n<h2>Using ReStructuredText markup (rst)</h2>\n<p>The reStructuredText specification allows for a certain degree of flexibility in markup to achieve your goals. For example, you can use any one of more than a dozen characters for section title underlines, and you have the option of using an overline in addition to an underline.</p>\n<p>The majority of Mattermost technical documentation is written in <code>.rst</code>. The examples below describe the conventions we use when writing in <code>.rst</code>.</p>\n<h3>Page titles</h3>\n<p>Underline page titles using <code>=</code>, with no overline. Underlines should be as long as the title text.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">  Document Title\n  ==============\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Section titles</h3>\n<p>Underline using <code>-</code> for section titles.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">  Section title\n  -------------\n</code></pre>\n<p>Underline subsections using <code>~</code> for the first subsection level, and <code>^</code> for the second subsection level.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">  Subsection one\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n  Subsection two\n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Table of contents</h3>\n<p>Insert a table of contents into a document using the following format:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">  .. contents::\n      :backlinks: top\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Text formatting</h3>\n<p>Use highlighting of text to visually set off words and phrases that are important to readers. Content that should be highlighted includes file names, UI controls, and window titles. The following table has a comprehensive list with examples.</p>\n<p>| Text | Format | Example |  |\n| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |\n| Commands | <code>monospace</code>  | \"At the command line, type <code>sudo apt-get install nginx</code>.\" |  |\n| Directory name | <code>monospace</code>  | <code>/opt/mattermost</code> |  |\n| File name | <code>monospace</code>  | <code>config.py</code> |  |\n| Inline code | <code>monospace</code>  | <code>fmt.Printf(\"2 times %d = %d\\n\", x, y )</code> |  |\n| Keystrokes | <code>monospace</code>  | \"Type <code>https://</code> in the string field.\" |  |\n| Screen output | <code>monospace</code>  | See :ref:<code>literal-blocks</code> for an example. |  |\n| Parameter values | <code>monospace</code>  | \"Set the <em>auto-config</em> parameter to <code>false</code>\" |  |\n| Field names | <code>**bold**</code> | If the field has punctuation, include that in the formatting. For example \"Enter the URL in the <strong>Enter URL:</strong> field.\" |  |\n| Clickable control | <code>**bold**</code> | \"Click <strong>File &gt; Save</strong>.\" |  |\n| UI elements | <code>**bold**</code> | \"Open <strong>Main Menu &gt; Account Settings</strong>.\" |  |\n| Dialog boxes | <code>**bold**</code> | \"The <strong>Create Thread</strong> window opens.\" |  |\n| Citations | <code>*italic*</code> | \"Read the book <em>Clean Code</em> by Robert Martin.\" |  |\n| User account names | <code>*italic*</code> | \"Log in to the <em>mysql</em> account.\" |  |\n| Parameter names | <code>*italic*</code> | \"Set the <em>auto-config</em> parameter to <code>false</code>\" |  |\n| Keyboard buttons | Key1+Key2 | \"Press CTRL+U to upload a file.\" |  |\n| Placeholder field | {placeholder} | \"Use the URL in the form of {hostname}.mattermost.com/{team}.\" |  |</p>\n<h3>Bullet lists</h3>\n<p>For bullet lists and sublists, use <code>-</code> before the list item.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">  - list item one\n  - list item two\n    - sublist item one\n    - sublist item two\n  - list item three\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Numbered lists and procedure steps</h3>\n<p>Create numbered lists and procedure steps using numbers for the top-level list and lowercase alpha characters for the first nested list.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">  1. This is item one.\n  2. This is item two.\n\n    a. This is nested item one.\n    b. This is nested item two.\n\n  3. This is item three.\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Name-value groups</h3>\n<p>Use a name-value group instead of a hand-created list.</p>\n<p>A name-value group is typically a group of terms and their corresponding definitions, but can also be questions and answers, topics and values, or other name-value groups. In HTML output, a name-value group is represented as a definition list.</p>\n<p>Preferred\n  Total Users\n    The total number of active accounts created on your system. Excludes inactive accounts.\n  Total Teams\n    The total number of teams created on your system.</p>\n<p>Avoid\n  <strong>Total Users:</strong> The total number of active accounts created on your system. Excludes inactive accounts.</p>\n<p><strong>Total Teams:</strong>  The total number of teams created on your system.</p>\n<p>To create a name-value group such as a definition list, type the term on a line by itself. On the next line, indent the definition.</p>\n<pre><code>  Total users\n    The total number of active accounts created on your system. Excludes inactive accounts.\n  Total teams\n    The total number of teams created on your system.\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Documentation links</h3>\n<h4>External links</h4>\n<p>External links take readers to a page outside of the Mattermost product documentation. External link URLs are automatically rendered as links in Sphinx (when formatted correctly). Where possible, incorporate hyperlinks within the text of a sentence by lowercasing the link text. </p>\n<p>External hyperlinks within a sentence can be created using the following formatting:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">`Link display text &lt;URL-of-website&gt;`__\n\nFor example:\n  `Mattermost Product Pricing &lt;https://www.mattermost.com/pricing/&gt;`__\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note the full URL, the opening and closing single quotes, and the two underline characters at the end of the link syntax.</p>\n<p>The link above renders as: <a href=\"https://www.mattermost.com/pricing\">Mattermost Product Pricing</a>.</p>\n<h4>Internal links</h4>\n<p>Internal links take readers to a page within the Mattermost product documentation. When creating links to pages in the product documentation, always use a relative URL instead of an external (or absolute) link. A link with an absolute URL is not as flexible as a relative URL. Relative URLs don't break when the documentation is moved to another host, or if the documentation is hosted on a server that's behind a firewall without access to the Internet.</p>\n<h5>Link to another page in the same section</h5>\n<p>To create a link to another documentation page within the same section of the product documentation, use the following formatting:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">:doc:`Link display text &lt;/folder/filename&gt;`\n\nFor example, when you want to add a link on a Channels page to another Channels page:\n  See the :doc:`channel preferences &lt;/channels/set-channel-preferences&gt;` documentation for details.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notes: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The file extension is not part of the syntax, and that two underline characters are missing. Sphinx uses the title of the document as the link text.</li>\n<li>If you're looking to create an internal link to a section on another page (as opposed to creating a link to the top of a page in general), the syntax above won't work. Docs is investigating further to identify a solution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Sphinx, references are constructed using roles, and roles point to locations in the documentation set. The two roles that are relevant in Mattermost documentation are the <code>:doc:</code> role and the <code>:ref:</code> role. In both cases, the HTML output is a relative URL for the target location.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>:doc:</code> role is used for creating relative links to other documents. </li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>:ref:</code> role is used for creating relative links to arbitrary locations within the documentation set, including within the same document, based on a unique identifier specified at the top of a source file. The <code>:ref:</code> role is a two-part construct. One part is the link itself, and the other part is the target on the source page.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The link itself is specified as: :ref:<code>arbitrary-text-label</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>The target is added as the first line of the source page (preceding the title): <code>.. _arbitrary-text-label:</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Link to a section heading on the current page</h5>\n<p>To create a link to a section heading on the current page, identify the unique anchor ID assigned to the section title in a local build, a remote build, or within production, then use the following formatting:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">`Link display text &lt;#uniqueanchorID&gt;`__\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Bullet lists</h3>\n<pre><code>\nTo generate a link to the section, use the `:ref:` role as follows:\n\n```text\n  For more information about bullet lists, see :ref:`arbitrary-text-label`.\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Sphinx processor creates a relative link to the section, and uses the section title as the link text. On output, the link looks like this: \"For more information about bullet lists, see :ref:<code>arbitrary-text-label</code>.\"</p>\n<h3>Images</h3>\n<p>Use the following construct to insert an image:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">  .. image:: ../images/choices.png\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should use <code>alt</code> tag for all images.</p>\n<p>You can also add the following image options: <code>height</code>, <code>width</code>, <code>scale</code>, <code>align</code>, and <code>target</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">  .. image:: ../images/choices.png\n    :alt: The choices that you can make.\n    :height: 100px //number refers to pixels\n    :width: 200px //number refers to pixels\n    :align: left //left, right or middle\n    :scale: 50 //number is a percentage\n</code></pre>\n<p>Inserting an inline image is a bit more complicated. It's a two-part construct that consists of a label and the image directive. Surround the label text with vertical bars, the <code>|</code> character.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">  Some of the emoji that you can use are |emoji|.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then insert the following image directive at the bottom of the document:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">  .. |emoji| image:: ../images/emoji.png\n    :alt: Some of the emoji that you can use.\n    :align: middle\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Literal blocks</h3>\n<p>To use a literal block with no syntax highlighting, use the Sphinx code-block directive with the language set to <code>none</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">  .. code-block:: none\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Code blocks with syntax highlighting</h3>\n<p>To create a code block with syntax highlighting, use the Sphinx code-block directive with the language set to the language that you want highlighted. <a href=\"http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/\">Many languages are available</a>, but in Mattermost documentation the most likely ones are as follows:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">- go\n- rest\n- html\n- javascript\n- coffee\n- bash\n</code></pre>\n<p>The following example is a block of Go code.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">  .. code-block:: go\n    :linenos:\n\n    newPassword := props[&quot;new_password&quot;]\n      if err := utils.IsPasswordValid(newPassword); err != nil {\n          c.Err = err\n          return\n      }\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Archive documentation pages</h3>\n<p>When a documentation page is no longer needed, that page should be archived. Archiving a page prevents that page from being included in the build altogether.</p>\n<p>To archive a documentation page:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Identify where you want the reader to go instead of the page that's being archived.</li>\n<li>Move the source file to the <code>/source/archive</code> folder.</li>\n<li>(RST files only) In the file you just moved to the <code>archive</code> folder, add <code>:nosearch:</code> at the top of the file (above any anchor identifier, title, or code comment present in the file). This prevents the documentation page from being returned in search results.</li>\n<li>Add a redirect to the <code>conf.py</code> file from the archived page to a new destination page.</li>\n<li>Search for and replace any links across the documentation set to the archived file, including LHS, landing pages, and paragraph-level links.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Silence <code>not in toctree</code> build warnings</h3>\n<p>When working and building the documentation locally in a development environment, writers can review build warnings and errors in the <code>/build/warnings.log</code> file. Build warnings and errors can include (but aren't limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Broken links</li>\n<li>Documentation pages missing from the LHS unintentionally</li>\n<li>Syntax and formatting issues</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As part of monthly documentation release cycles, technical writers review and take action on build warnings and errors reported.</p>\n<p>To silence warnings for RST documentation pages that are missing from the LHS unintentionally, add <code>:orphan:</code> at the top of the file (above any anchor identifier, title, or code comment present in the file). The next time the product documentation is built, that warning is silenced. (A documentation page can contain both <code>:nosearch:</code> and <code>:orphan:</code>, and these two directives can be listed in either order).</p>\n<h3>Stop a documentation page from being returned in search results</h3>\n<p>Some documentation pages should never be returned in search results, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Archived pages.</li>\n<li>Unofficial documentation pages. All unofficial product documentation should live within the <a href=\"https://forum.mattermost.com/c/docs/37\">Mattermost Discussion Forums</a>.</li>\n<li>Pages that exist only to be included on other documentation pages. These pages often don't provide enough context to be useful if accessed directly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To prevent RST documentation pages from being returned in search results, add <code>:nosearch:</code> at the top of the file (above any anchor identifier, title, or code comment present in the file. (A documentation page can contain both <code>:nosearch:</code> and <code>:orphan:</code>, and these two directives can be listed in either order).</p>\n<h3>Add code comments</h3>\n<p>Adding code comments to documentation source files helps contributors understand why specific decisions were made or what additional knowledge is required when working within a specific source file. For example, if a documentation page isn't accessible in the LHS by design, adding a code comment in the source file helps future contributors understand that it was an intentional decision.</p>\n<p>In RST files, format code comments as <code>.. Code comment text here</code>. Code comment text isn't visible to users in the published product documentation.</p>\n<h3>Embed videos in product documentation</h3>\n<p>To accommodate the many ways that people learn, its helpful to include visual elements, such as videos, in the Mattermost product documentation. The process and code needed to embed a video on a documentation page differs depending on how the video is hosted. Mattermost typically hosts product videos through either YouTube or Wistia (and Wistia is preferrable over YouTube, when available, because viewers aren't subject to ads).</p>\n<h4>Embed a YouTube video on a page</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Obtain the YouTube video link.</li>\n<li>The code to embed the video consists of two parts: a paragraph-level link and iframe code. Copy the code below into the documentation source file, then update the introduction text and replace the <code>YouTubeVideoLink</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">See our `tutorial video on YouTube &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YouTubeVideoLink&gt;`_. \n\n.. raw:: html\n\n   &lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; padding-bottom: 50%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YouTubeVideoLink&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Embed a Wistia video on a page</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Request the <a href=\"https://wistia.com/support/embed-and-share/media-on-your-website#inline-embeds\">Wistia inline embedded code snippet</a> from the video producer. </li>\n<li>Copy and paste the code you receive into the documentation source file. The code you receive will look similar to the following example:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">.. raw:: html\n\n  &lt;script src=&quot;https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/5gjgi10rr0.jsonp&quot; async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js&quot; async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wistia_responsive_padding&quot; style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wistia_responsive_wrapper&quot; style=&quot;height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wistia_embed wistia_async_5gjgi10rr0 videoFoam=true&quot; style=&quot;height:100%;position:relative;width:100%&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wistia_swatch&quot; style=&quot;height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/5gjgi10rr0/swatch&quot; style=&quot;filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; onload=&quot;this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Plan and deployment badges</h3>\n<p>Most Mattermost product documentation pages feature plan and deployment badges located directly under the page title or section title. These badges indicate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Mattermost subscription plans that support the feature or function. Options include <strong>All Plans</strong>, <strong>Enterprise</strong>, and <strong>Professional</strong>.</li>\n<li>The Mattermost deployment approach that supports the feature or function. Options include <strong>Cloud</strong> or <strong>Self-hosted</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These badges are defined on a per-page basis as inline images located close to the top of the source file. Please be careful to avoid making changes to the badge code when modifing other aspects of the documentation page.</p>\n<p>Note that, longer term, it would be ideal to replace the current badge implementation with a more programmatic solution where the badges are defined once and simply referenced across all applicable documentation pages.</p>\n<h2>Using Markdown</h2>\n<p>The majority of Mattermost technical documentation is written in <code>.rst</code> format. However, there are some instances where Markdown is used, for example the Mattermost Handbook. You can read more about using Markdown in the <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/messaging/formatting-text.html\">Formatting Text</a> section of the Mattermost product documentation.</p>\n<h2>Manage and resolve merge conflicts</h2>\n<p>Mattermost hosts the source code and content of its technical documentation in GitHub repositories. Documentation is updated by submitting pull requests on GitHub. After a pull request is reviewed and approved, it is usually merged into the master branch without further changes.

        "content": "# Feature documentation process: Product Manager and Developers\n\n## Submitting feature documentation\n\nFeature documentation is a joint effort between Product Managers, Developers, and Technical Writers. In the same way that we want to empower everyone to contribute to our documentation, Product Managers are encouraged to write MVP documentation for their product/feature.\n\nFeature changes and new features first exist as code PRs. These PRs form the basis of whatever changes are being documented. If a code PR is for a new feature, major update to an existing feature, or a fix that impacts the current documentation, it's recommended that a documentation update is made. The Technical Writers work closely with their development teams to ensure that these types of changes are documented accordingly. \n\nOne way we do this is by using the `Docs/Needed` label. When a code PR is submitted, that may have documentation impact, the `Docs/Needed` label is added. The assigned writer then reviews the PR and, if there are documentation changes needed, opens a PR in the docs repo with reference to the code PR.\n\nAs a developer you are also welcome to update the documentation yourself in one of the following ways:\n\n* Update the relevant page on [docs.mattermost.com](https://docs.mattermost.com), and submit a PR for that. This PR is submitted to the docs repo, reviewed by the relevant team members, and merged from there.\n* Submit your documentation as a new file, including the context and changes, any code samples, and processes. You can submit this as part of your code PR, or you can open a new PR in the docs repo and include a link to your open code PR.\n\nWe don't expect a huge body of documentation or that it's perfectly-written - but rather a clear, concise outline of the change which can be added to our documentation. The content can be provided as a list, rough notes, or you can use the example below for content and structural guidance if your documentation is quite detailed.\n\n**Note:** Due to the cadence of the release cycle, feature documentation needs to be complete and submitted as [per the release process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/release-process/feature-release#e-t-minus-15-working-days-judgment-day) to allow sufficient time for review and to ensure it's included in the release documentation update.\n\nThe supplied content can be provided informally, in bullet points, or rough notes in a Google Doc/on the PR itself. Refinements are made collaboratively.\n\n### Feature documentation MVP \\(Product Managers\\)\n\nA [Mattermost PM feature template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16SRPKFWEtwPILQ0zNGbApbp9atICTfzgdTFuvYqSZAg/edit) is available to help Product Managers and Techical Writers capture details about new features and functionality that need product documentation.\n\nThis is a guideline of what MVP feature documentation can include. Requirements vary based on the scope of the change, so not everything will always be needed:\n\n* A link to the feature/product's tech spec.\n* Links to any relevant Jira/GitHub issues.\n* A description of the product/feature/update which forms the basis of the documentation.\n* Steps for any processes or procedures \\(configuration of a feature, troubleshooting, etc\\).\n* Any FAQs or troubleshooting questions if relevant.\n* Any limitations, issues, or known problems.\n* Configuration settings and examples for the `config.json` file if relevant.\n* \\(If possible\\) Suggestions of where in the docs the content should go.\n\nWhen the content has been refined and approved in draft format:\n\n* The Product Manager/Technical Writer creates a branch off the relevant documentation release branch.\n* The documentation is updated with the approved content in that branch.\n  * If there are multiple pages to update for a specific feature/change please keep them all in the same branch for ease of management.\n* The PR is submitted and relevant reviewers added, including an editor \\(not the Technical Writer who wrote the docs\\), for final review.\n  * Include the link to the server/webapp repo issue in your PR for reference purposes.\n* Once all reviews are complete, the PR is marked as **Reviews Complete** and merged into the documentation release branch by @amyblais.\n\nYou can read more about the review process [here](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/code-review).\n\nYou can find additional guidance around formatting [here](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-processes/publishing/publishing-guidelines/voice-tone-and-writing-style-guidelines/documentation-style-guide#using-restructuredtext-markup-rst).\n\nOnce your PR is submitted, there's a review process that includes an editorial review, a PM review, and sometimes a dev review. During the editorial review, editors may make punctuation and/or terminology changes and commit them to save time on the review process. This only applies to punctuation/terminology - content suggestions and questions will follow the usual review and discussion process.\n\nOnce the review is complete, we'll move your contribution to the appropriate part of [docs.mattermost.com](https://docs.mattermost.com) \\(if it's not there already\\) and then merge it. We'll share the URL and you can edit it at any time if you need to.\n\n## Add reviewers to PRs\n\nMattermost documentation covers a number of different topics. For documentation, the following reviewers are recommended:\n\n**Editor Review**\n\n* Carrie Warner \\(@cwarnermm\\)\n* Justine Geffen \\(@justinegeffen\\)\n\n**Product Manager Review**\n\n* Product: Ian Tao \\(@tao\\); Winson Wu (\\@wuwinson\\)\n* Integrations: Sandy Atkinson \\(@asatkinson\\)\n* Security: Daniel Schalla \\(@dschalla\\)\n* Server/calls: Neil Barnett \\(nab-77)\\\n* Self-serve: John Lugtu \\(@johndavidlugtu)\\\n* Growth: Eric Sethna \\(@esethna\\)\n\n* Handbook and Process; Community: Jason Blais \\(@jasonblais\\)\n\n**Dev Review**\n\nIf your change requires dev review add the developer/s you've been working with as the reviewer/s. If you're unsure who to add as a dev reviewer you can select one of the team leads below:\n\n* Product: Scott Bishel \\(@sbishel\\)\n* Integrations: Catalin Tomei \\(@catalintomai\\)\n* Growth: Maria Nu\u00f1ez \\(@marianunez\\)\n* SRE: Stylianos Rigas \\(@stylianos\\)\n* Cloud Platform: Spiros Economakis \\(@spiros\\)\n* Mobile: Elias Nahum \\(@enahum\\)\n* Web/desktop app: Pantelis Vratsalis \\(@pantelis\\)\n* Security: Daniel Schalla \\(@dschalla\\)\n* QA: Saturn Abril \\(@saturninoabril\\)\n\nThe full list of R&D teams is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lH8QIjQGEoGospDUdVs_LQ_i2b82I1ce6W7z18vhPTQ/edit#gid=1730823498).\n\n## Providing editorial feedback\n\nIf you're asked to provide editorial feedback on a PR, and it's your first editorial feedback request, first read up on the review process [here](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/code-review) to get an idea of what's expected in terms of turnaround time, type of feedback, and so on.\n\nEditorial feedback is based on the guidelines laid out in the [Documentation Style Guide](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-processes/publishing/publishing-guidelines/voice-tone-and-writing-style-guidelines/documentation-style-guide) as well as the [Voice, Tone, and Writing Style Guide](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/publishing/publishing-guidelines/voice-tone-and-writing-style-guidelines).\n",

When contributing to our product documentation, it's important to choose contributions that are a good match your skills and experience. For example, it may not make sense for you to work on a database installation update if you haven't installed Mattermost before, or don't have experience configuring databases.

We look forward to seeing what you produce.\n\n## Reviews and editing\n\nWe don't expect perfection, so please don't spend a lot of time trying to follow the style guide rigorously. That's our job!

        "content": "# Docathon 2021\n\nThe first Mattermost Docathon is being held from July 26th to August 6th 2021. Take a look at our [blog post](https://mattermost.com/blog/docathon-2021/) if you haven't already.\n\n## What's a Docathon?\n\nA docathon is a hackathon for product documentation.\n\n## Why a Docathon?\n\nDocumentation isn't written in a vacuum, and it's important to see the customer\u2019s documentation journey through the eyes of our Mattermost community. The best way to do that is to get our community involved! Documentation is also a great way to get started on your open source contribution journey as it's usually how you get to know the product.\n\n## Who can participate?\n\nThe Docathon is designed to provide opportunities for all contributors to get involved, whether new to open source or seasoned contributors. Help us solve technical tooling challenges. Write mobile steps for Mattermost messaging tasks. Correct inaccuracies and inconsistencies. Add or update screenshots, labeled images, animated GIFs, and videos. How do you want to improve the Mattermost product documentation?\n\n## Can Mattermost staff help?\n\nAbsolutely! Here are some ways you can get involved:\n\n* **Help us merge PR submissions:** This includes helping us go through the PRs with the **Docathon 2021** label, making sure PRs follow our style guide, and fixing any grammatical issues. This isn't an extremely rigorous process - we just want to make sure anything merged follows some standardization.\n* **Help review technical content for accuracy:** Actively monitor the [~Docathon 2021](https://community-daily.mattermost.com/core/channels/docathon2021) channel, respond to questions, and engage community members who post with questions or concerns. You can also help by being open to contributors messaging you directly if they have questions and prefer not to ask in the public channel, and relay any feedback back to the Technical Writing team.\n* **Help us with Linked In recommendations or endorsements for top contributors:** This is particularly welcome in cases where, during PR reviews, you encounter Docathon contributors you want to network with and whose professional career you want to support.\n* **Contribute your own content or ideas for either Mattermost product documentation, or the Docathon event itself!**\n\n## Judging and prizes\n\nOne of our goals for this Docathon is for our documentation to benefit from great, high-quality contributions that really increase their value.\n\nContributors who contribute one or more merged PRs will receive a Mattermost swag pack. Contributors with 5+ merged PRs will receive LinkedIn and/or GitHub endorsements and recommendations from some of our professional tech writers and product managers.\n\nThe top five contributions will each receive 1 pair of AirPod Pro headphones.\n\nSo, how are the contributions assessed?\n\n### What's a \"valid\" contribution?\n\nA valid contribution is one that isn't done just for the sake of submitting a PR, but one that fixes an error, improves existing content, or adds value to our product documentation. While there are no penalties for submitting invalid Docathon PRs, if you're not sure how to contribute, please ask us how to get involved - we're more than happy to help get you started.\n\n### What's a good contribution?\n\nA good contribution delivers clear value. The problem space is relevant to Mattermost, the solution fits Mattermost's documentation technology stack, and there's a clear plan to move forward with the contribution and merge it into the repository.\n\nGood contributions achieve one or more of the following goals:\n\n* Solves a known problem.\n* Fills an existing gap.\n* Offers a fresh perspective.\n* Clarifies, expands, supplements, illustrates, corrects, or updates existing content with imagery, examples, or recommendations based on real-world experience.\n* Requires minimum work to implement.\n\nIf you're contributing to our documentation with your own ideas \\(i.e., not based on existing GitHub issues\\) that's great! Please clearly describe the problem space you're addressing in your PR. This context is important and helps us evaluate incoming PRs effectively.\n\n### What's a great contribution?\n\nAs Mattermost reviews and evaluates Docathon contributions, we're looking for the following attributes:\n\n* **Impact:** The contribution is trying to solve something that's relevant to the Mattermost product documentation.\n* **Quality:** The contribution is useful, high-quality, and easy to merge into the codebase as-is or with minimum effort.\n* **Ambition:** The contribution addresses an issue in a better, faster, clearer, or simpler way than before.\n* **Innovation:** The contribution breaks new ground or offers documentation visitors something new or unexpected.\n\nA great Docathon contribution has elements of all four attributes above, is not only highly relevant to Mattermost's interests, and a good fit for the product documentation, but also useful and easy to implement.\n\nGreat contributions aim to achieve one or more of the following goals:\n\n* Improve the user's product documentation journey in a meaningful, measurable way.\n* Elevate and/or breathe new life to existing content.\n* Introduce a faster, easier, and/or better way of doing, saying, or showing something.\n\nWe don't expect greatness from every contribution - copy-editing is as important as a huge body of work - but if you are taking on a large issue, these criteria might be helpful to keep in mind.\n\n",

While there are no penalties for submitting invalid Docathon PRs, if you're not sure how to contribute, please ask us how to get involved - we're more than happy to help get you started.</p>\n<h3>What's a good contribution?</h3>\n<p>A good contribution delivers clear value. The problem space is relevant to Mattermost, the solution fits Mattermost's documentation technology stack, and there's a clear plan to move forward with the contribution and merge it into the repository.</p>\n<p>Good contributions achieve one or more of the following goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Solves a known problem.</li>\n<li>Fills an existing gap.</li>\n<li>Offers a fresh perspective.</li>\n<li>Clarifies, expands, supplements, illustrates, corrects, or updates existing content with imagery, examples, or recommendations based on real-world experience.</li>\n<li>Requires minimum work to implement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're contributing to our documentation with your own ideas (i.e., not based on existing GitHub issues) that's great! Please clearly describe the problem space you're addressing in your PR. This context is important and helps us evaluate incoming PRs effectively.</p>\n<h3>What's a great contribution?</h3>\n<p>As Mattermost reviews and evaluates Docathon contributions, we're looking for the following attributes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact:</strong> The contribution is trying to solve something that's relevant to the Mattermost product documentation.</li>\n<li><strong>Quality:</strong> The contribution is useful, high-quality, and easy to merge into the codebase as-is or with minimum effort.</li>\n<li><strong>Ambition:</strong> The contribution addresses an issue in a better, faster, clearer, or simpler way than before.</li>\n<li><strong>Innovation:</strong> The contribution breaks new ground or offers documentation visitors something new or unexpected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A great Docathon contribution has elements of all four attributes above, is not only highly relevant to Mattermost's interests, and a good fit for the product documentation, but also useful and easy to implement.</p>\n<p>Great contributions aim to achieve one or more of the following goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the user's product documentation journey in a meaningful, measurable way.</li>\n<li>Elevate and/or breathe new life to existing content.</li>\n<li>Introduce a faster, easier, and/or better way of doing, saying, or showing something.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We don't expect greatness from every contribution - copy-editing is as important as a huge body of work - but if you are taking on a large issue, these criteria might be helpful to keep in mind.</p>",

        "content": "# Overview\n\nThis document will provide an overview of Mattermost\u2019s A/B Testing methodology. It consists of a sequence of steps and considerations to design valid A/B tests.\n\n## A/B Testing Methodology\n### Defining the Goal/Objective\nBefore you can determine the success criteria \\(i.e. the metric that measures success\\), you must clearly articulate what the goal/objective of your AB test is. This goal/objective is a statement about the behavior you're trying to influence, the direction of that influence, and the method for achieving that influence. \n\nAn example of a goal/objective could be:\n\n1. Objective: Increase early user retention and engagement.\n  * Method: Alter the location and design of the invite member feature.\n\n2. Objective: Increase Cloud free-to-paid conversions.\n  * Method: Alter design of the purchasing process within the Billing & Subscription section of the Admin Console.\n\n3. Objective: Increase conversions of Mattermost Cloud Trial Sign Ups\n  * Method: Alter paid ad messaging, visuals, and/or targeting.\n\nAll of the above goals/objectives have a clear metric that can be measured to compare the performance of various tests and control groups. It is important when conceptualizing an AB test to define a goal/objective that produces a measurable outcome.\n\n### Success Criteria\nFirst you must decide what the success criteria of your A/B test will be. The following questions must be answered in order to formulate a proper A/B testing hypothesis:\n\n1. What is the metric or measure you are trying to influence? \\(i.e. What action or outcome are you trying to influence?\\)\n  * This must be a concise definition that prevents the metric from changing over time.\n  * A/B tests tend to work best when working with proportions i.e. the percentage of users to take an action similar to conversion rates.\n2. Which direction are you trying to influence the measure \\(increase, decrease or no directional preference\\)?\n3. Can the measure be compared to historical benchmarks?\n  * Is it a static measure \\(one that will not change as more time passes\\)?\n  * Historical benchmarks simplify sample size requirement calculations and provide us with a better understanding of the time required to run a test \\(i.e. the amount of time required to collect enough data/reach a large enough sample\\).\n4. Once this has been established, you will need to establish the MDE \\(Minimum Detectable Effect Size\\). You can learn more about the [MDE statistic in this section](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/growth/ab-testing#minimum-detectable-effect-size-mde).\n\nThe success criteria of an A/B test is based on one to two clearly defined measures, and how an intervention hopes to influence them i.e. increase, decrease, or change \\(regardless of direction\\). Clearly defined measures ensure the ability to quantify the impact of interventions, thereby allowing you to measure the success or failure of a test.\n\nExamples of valid success criteria metrics/measures:\n1. First 14-Day Invite Member Conversion Rate: Proportion of total users to invite new members w/in the first 14 days of first activity\n    * I.e. the percentage of total users that trigger an invite member event w/in 14 days of the user\u2019s first active timestamp.\n2. Cloud Workspace Creation Conversion Rate: Proportion of unique visitors to the Cloud Trial Signup Page that successfully create a cloud workspace\n\n### Formulating Hypotheses\nOnce you\u2019ve defined the target measure and established the success criteria, you must determine the [null and alternative hypotheses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qlxt0HmuOo) of the test. The null hypothesis is always that the intervention will have no effect on the target measure i.e. Test Outcome = Control Outcome. The alternative hypothesis determines the type of change we\u2019re testing for. If the alternative hypothesis is that the intervention will affect the measure, regardless of direction (Test Outcome \u2260 Control Outcome), then the test is 2-sided. If the alternative hypothesis is that the intervention will increase \\(or decrease\\) our target measure \\(Test Outcome > | < Control Outcome\\) then this is a 1-sided test.\n\nExample of valid Null & Alternative Hypothesis:\n* H\ud835\udfb1 \\(Null Hypothesis\\): Adding an invite members icon to the banner will have no effect on the First 14-Day Invite Member Conversion Rate. \n  * \ud835\udfb1 = \ud835\udfb10\n* Ha \\(One-Sided Alternative Hypothesis\\): Adding an invite members icon to the banner will increase the First 14-Day Invite Member Conversion Rate. \n  * \ud835\udfb1 > \ud835\udfb10\n* Ha \\(Two-Sided Alternative Hypothesis\\): Adding an invite members icon to the banner will change \\(either direction\\) the First 14-Day Invite Member Conversion Rate. \n  * \ud835\udfb1 \u2260 \ud835\udfb10\n\n\n### Minimum Detectable Effect Size \\(MDE\\)\nThe MDE is essentially the minimum relative change between test and control means to justify the changes. A smaller MDE requires a larger sample size, i.e. ability to confidently claim a small change to the baseline in the test group is statistically significant. A relative MDE of 15%-20% is typical for proportions and conversion rates, but the MDE will vary based on the metric specified by the Success Criteria.\n\n#### Example \nThe Product Team wants to increase the proportion of users that invite members within the first 14 days on the platform. They\u2019re evaluating two potential UI changes \\(interventions\\) to affect this change: \n1. Test 1: Placing an icon at the top of the left-hand sidebar channel switcher.\n2. Test 2: Placing a banner button at the bottom of the left-hand sidebar channel switcher. \n3. Control: Hold the current UI constant.\n\nThe Product Team is targeting at least a 20% relative increase in the proportion of users that invite members within the first 14 days on the platform. This desired relative change in the proportion of users to \u201cconvert\u201d will help govern our calculations for the minimum required sample size, and transitively the amount of time the A/B test will have to run in order to collect the minimum required sample size for each group \\(test 1, test 2, and the control group\\).\n\n### Sample Size\nThe next step in formulating an A/B test involves determining the minimum required sample size to produce statistically significant results i.e. adequate confidence level and statistical power.\n\nThis step is key. It does not need to be done in advance, although it will help you better understand how long the test will need to be run in order to achieve the desired statistical power \\(Default = .8\\) and confidence level \\(Default = .95\\). \n\nThe statistical power \\(\u03b2\\), the confidence level \\(1-\ud835\udf36\\), the minimum detectable effect size \\(\ud835\udf48\\), the desired test outcome, as well as the historical measure benchmark \\(as a buffer for the control outcome\\) are all required to calculate the minimum required sample size. As the test progresses, the calculation for minimum required sample size will change as you\u2019re able to substitute hypothesized outcomes with actual results. The greater the change between groups, the smaller the sample size needed.\n\nThese variables and assumptions are listed below, as well as the formula for calculating the sample size for varying types of tests \\(1-tailed vs. 2-tailed\\).\n#### Variables & Assumptions\nn = Sample Size\n* This represents the sample size of each group. Ideally, the samples will be the same size for each test group and the control.\n* The sample size must be sufficiently large in order for the A/B test to have adequate statistical power \\(the typical statistical power for A/B tests is .8, which is 1 - \u03b2\\)\n\n\ud835\udf36 = Alpha: Uncertainty Level \\(Probability of Committing Type I Error\\)\n* Default = .05\n  * Meaning 1/20 chance there is an effect, but you conclude there is no effect\n\n\ud835\udf37 = Beta: \\(Probability of Committing Type II Error\\)\n* 1 - \u03b2 = Statistical Power\n\n\ud835\udfba1 = Proportion of group 1 to convert\n\n\ud835\udfba2 = Proportion of group 2 to convert\n\n\ud835\udf48 = |\ud835\udfba1 - \ud835\udfba2|\n* Absolute difference between proportion of group 1 and group 2\n\nZ = Z Score\n* Z Score dependent on the specified \ud835\udf36 \\(alpha\\) & \ud835\udf37 \\(beta\\) statistics\n\nOne-sided Test Sample Size Formula: \n* n = \\( \\(Z1-\ud835\udf36 * \u221a \ud835\udfba1*\\(1- \ud835\udfba1\\) \\) + \\(Z1-\ud835\udf37 * \u221a \ud835\udfba2*\\(1- \ud835\udfba2\\) \\) \\) / \ud835\udf48 )^2 \n\nTwo-sided Sample Size Formula: \n* n = \\( \\(Z1-\ud835\udf36/2 * \u221a \ud835\udfba1*\\(1- \ud835\udfba1\\) \\) + \\(Z1-\ud835\udf37 * \u221a \ud835\udfba2*\\(1- \ud835\udfba2\\) \\) \\) / \ud835\udf48 \\)^2\n\n![](../../../.gitbook/assets/z-score-table.png)\n\nThere are online AB test sample size calculators that allow you to determine the minimum required sample size per test variation. These tests allow you to quickly check the required sample size to achieve an adequate level of statistical power and confidence. [This AB Test Sample Size Calculator by AB Testguide](https://abtestguide.com/abtestsize/) provides the option to switch between one and two-sided tests, as well as specify industry standard powers and confidence levels. The duration of the test depends on the volume of users and instances being created over time. The fewer being created the longer the test will take. Given Mattermost's current Cloud sign up frequency it would take at least 12-16 weeks for a single test on new end users to reach a industry-accepted level of statistical power and confidence. Which requires patience our fast-paced culture does not often permit... All the more reason to increase the breadth and depth of our marketing and business development initiatives.\n\n### Design & Implementation\nWhen designing an A/B test, it\u2019s key to:\n1. Simplify the test changes as much as possible.\n  * This ensures there are minimal confounding factors that could affect the outcome of a test. \n    * I.e. do not make multiple changes in a single test group or we will not be able to attribute a specific change as the factor affecting the test outcome. \n    * For instance, don\u2019t add a new icon to the UI, while simultaneously adding emphasis to that icon without testing for just the icon placement \\(w/ no emphasis\\) in another test group.\n2. Minimize the number of test variations\n  * Running too many variations of tests at a time can also cause the time required to achieve appropriate power and confidence to increase exponentially.\n3. Monitor data collection to ensure the sample sizes are \\(approximately\\) equally distributed.\n  * If the sample sizes begin to diverge, additional calculations must be performed to determine the minimum required sample sizes for adequate confidence and statistical power. Significantly different sample sizes also require a pooled variance calculation to account for the imbalances.\n4. Close out the test once adequate confidence and statistical power has been reached.\n  * This will allow us to expedite analysis of the test outcomes and implementation of the changes if the desired outcome is achieved.\n\n### Analyzing Results\n1. Calculate mean value of the target metric\n2. Calculate the variance standard deviation for each test & control group\n  * For proportion-based target metrics the calculation is:\n  * Variance\n    * s1 = \\(\ud835\udfba1 * \\(1-\ud835\udfba1\\)\\) / n1\n    * s2 = \\(\ud835\udfba2 * \\(1-\ud835\udfba2\\)\\) / n2\n  * Standard deviation\n    * s1 = \u221a \\(\ud835\udfba1 * \\(1-\ud835\udfba1\\)\\) / n1\n    * s2 = \u221a \\(\ud835\udfba2 * (1-\ud835\udfba2\\)\\) / n2\n3. Calculate p-value\n  * Ensure no overlap between confidence intervals of tests and control\n4. Reject or accept null hypothesis\n",

You can learn more about the <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/growth/ab-testing#minimum-detectable-effect-size-mde\">MDE statistic in this section</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The success criteria of an A/B test is based on one to two clearly defined measures, and how an intervention hopes to influence them i.e. increase, decrease, or change (regardless of direction). Clearly defined measures ensure the ability to quantify the impact of interventions, thereby allowing you to measure the success or failure of a test.</p>\n<p>Examples of valid success criteria metrics/measures:\n1. First 14-Day Invite Member Conversion Rate: Proportion of total users to invite new members w/in the first 14 days of first activity\n    * I.e. the percentage of total users that trigger an invite member event w/in 14 days of the user\u2019s first active timestamp.\n2. Cloud Workspace Creation Conversion Rate: Proportion of unique visitors to the Cloud Trial Signup Page that successfully create a cloud workspace</p>\n<h3>Formulating Hypotheses</h3>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve defined the target measure and established the success criteria, you must determine the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qlxt0HmuOo\">null and alternative hypotheses</a> of the test. The null hypothesis is always that the intervention will have no effect on the target measure i.e. Test Outcome = Control Outcome. The alternative hypothesis determines the type of change we\u2019re testing for. If the alternative hypothesis is that the intervention will affect the measure, regardless of direction (Test Outcome \u2260 Control Outcome), then the test is 2-sided. If the alternative hypothesis is that the intervention will increase (or decrease) our target measure (Test Outcome &gt; | &lt; Control Outcome) then this is a 1-sided test.</p>\n<p>Example of valid Null &amp; Alternative Hypothesis:\n* H\ud835\udfb1 (Null Hypothesis): Adding an invite members icon to the banner will have no effect on the First 14-Day Invite Member Conversion Rate. \n  * \ud835\udfb1 = \ud835\udfb10\n* Ha (One-Sided Alternative Hypothesis): Adding an invite members icon to the banner will increase the First 14-Day Invite Member Conversion Rate. \n  * \ud835\udfb1 &gt; \ud835\udfb10\n* Ha (Two-Sided Alternative Hypothesis): Adding an invite members icon to the banner will change (either direction) the First 14-Day Invite Member Conversion Rate. \n  * \ud835\udfb1 \u2260 \ud835\udfb10</p>\n<h3>Minimum Detectable Effect Size (MDE)</h3>\n<p>The MDE is essentially the minimum relative change between test and control means to justify the changes. A smaller MDE requires a larger sample size, i.e. ability to confidently claim a small change to the baseline in the test group is statistically significant. A relative MDE of 15%-20% is typical for proportions and conversion rates, but the MDE will vary based on the metric specified by the Success Criteria.</p>\n<h4>Example</h4>\n<p>The Product Team wants to increase the proportion of users that invite members within the first 14 days on the platform. They\u2019re evaluating two potential UI changes (interventions) to affect this change: \n1. Test 1: Placing an icon at the top of the left-hand sidebar channel switcher.\n2. Test 2: Placing a banner button at the bottom of the left-hand sidebar channel switcher. \n3. Control: Hold the current UI constant.</p>\n<p>The Product Team is targeting at least a 20% relative increase in the proportion of users that invite members within the first 14 days on the platform. This desired relative change in the proportion of users to \u201cconvert\u201d will help govern our calculations for the minimum required sample size, and transitively the amount of time the A/B test will have to run in order to collect the minimum required sample size for each group (test 1, test 2, and the control group).</p>\n<h3>Sample Size</h3>\n<p>The next step in formulating an A/B test involves determining the minimum required sample size to produce statistically significant results i.e. adequate confidence level and statistical power.</p>\n<p>This step is key. It does not need to be done in advance, although it will help you better understand how long the test will need to be run in order to achieve the desired statistical power (Default = .8) and confidence level (Default = .95). </p>\n<p>The statistical power (\u03b2), the confidence level (1-\ud835\udf36), the minimum detectable effect size (\ud835\udf48), the desired test outcome, as well as the historical measure benchmark (as a buffer for the control outcome) are all required to calculate the minimum required sample size. As the test progresses, the calculation for minimum required sample size will change as you\u2019re able to substitute hypothesized outcomes with actual results. The greater the change between groups, the smaller the sample size needed.</p>\n<p>These variables and assumptions are listed below, as well as the formula for calculating the sample size for varying types of tests (1-tailed vs. 2-tailed).</p>\n<h4>Variables &amp; Assumptions</h4>\n<p>n = Sample Size\n* This represents the sample size of each group. Ideally, the samples will be the same size for each test group and the control.\n* The sample size must be sufficiently large in order for the A/B test to have adequate statistical power (the typical statistical power for A/B tests is .8, which is 1 - \u03b2)</p>\n<p>\ud835\udf36 = Alpha: Uncertainty Level (Probability of Committing Type I Error)\n* Default = .05\n  * Meaning 1/20 chance there is an effect, but you conclude there is no effect</p>\n<p>\ud835\udf37 = Beta: (Probability of Committing Type II Error)\n* 1 - \u03b2 = Statistical Power</p>\n<p>\ud835\udfba1 = Proportion of group 1 to convert</p>\n<p>\ud835\udfba2 = Proportion of group 2 to convert</p>\n<p>\ud835\udf48 = |\ud835\udfba1 - \ud835\udfba2|\n* Absolute difference between proportion of group 1 and group 2</p>\n<p>Z = Z Score\n* Z Score dependent on the specified \ud835\udf36 (alpha) &amp; \ud835\udf37 (beta) statistics</p>\n<p>One-sided Test Sample Size Formula: \n* n = ( (Z1-\ud835\udf36 * \u221a \ud835\udfba1<em>(1- \ud835\udfba1) ) + (Z1-\ud835\udf37 * \u221a \ud835\udfba2</em>(1- \ud835\udfba2) ) ) / \ud835\udf48 )^2 </p>\n<p>Two-sided Sample Size Formula: \n* n = ( (Z1-\ud835\udf36/2 * \u221a \ud835\udfba1<em>(1- \ud835\udfba1) ) + (Z1-\ud835\udf37 * \u221a \ud835\udfba2</em>(1- \ud835\udfba2) ) ) / \ud835\udf48 )^2</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/z-score-table.png\" /></p>\n<p>There are online AB test sample size calculators that allow you to determine the minimum required sample size per test variation. These tests allow you to quickly check the required sample size to achieve an adequate level of statistical power and confidence. <a href=\"https://abtestguide.com/abtestsize/\">This AB Test Sample Size Calculator by AB Testguide</a> provides the option to switch between one and two-sided tests, as well as specify industry standard powers and confidence levels. The duration of the test depends on the volume of users and instances being created over time. The fewer being created the longer the test will take. Given Mattermost's current Cloud sign up frequency it would take at least 12-16 weeks for a single test on new end users to reach a industry-accepted level of statistical power and confidence. Which requires patience our fast-paced culture does not often permit... All the more reason to increase the breadth and depth of our marketing and business development initiatives.</p>\n<h3>Design &amp; Implementation</h3>\n<p>When designing an A/B test, it\u2019s key to:\n1. Simplify the test changes as much as possible.\n  * This ensures there are minimal confounding factors that could affect the outcome of a test. \n    * I.e. do not make multiple changes in a single test group or we will not be able to attribute a specific change as the factor affecting the test outcome. \n    * For instance, don\u2019t add a new icon to the UI, while simultaneously adding emphasis to that icon without testing for just the icon placement (w/ no emphasis) in another test group.\n2. Minimize the number of test variations\n  * Running too many variations of tests at a time can also cause the time required to achieve appropriate power and confidence to increase exponentially.\n3. Monitor data collection to ensure the sample sizes are (approximately) equally distributed.\n  * If the sample sizes begin to diverge, additional calculations must be performed to determine the minimum required sample sizes for adequate confidence and statistical power. Significantly different sample sizes also require a pooled variance calculation to account for the imbalances.\n4. Close out the test once adequate confidence and statistical power has been reached.\n  * This will allow us to expedite analysis of the test outcomes and implementation of the changes if the desired outcome is achieved.</p>\n<h3>Analyzing Results</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Calculate mean value of the target metric</li>\n<li>Calculate the variance standard deviation for each test &amp; control group</li>\n<li>For proportion-based target metrics the calculation is:</li>\n<li>Variance<ul>\n<li>s1 = (\ud835\udfba1 * (1-\ud835\udfba1)) / n1</li>\n<li>s2 = (\ud835\udfba2 * (1-\ud835\udfba2)) / n2</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Standard deviation<ul>\n<li>s1 = \u221a (\ud835\udfba1 * (1-\ud835\udfba1)) / n1</li>\n<li>s2 = \u221a (\ud835\udfba2 * (1-\ud835\udfba2)) / n2</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Calculate p-value</li>\n<li>Ensure no overlap between confidence intervals of tests and control</li>\n<li>Reject or accept null hypothesis</li>\n</ol>",

This ensures in-product links are not broken in the event that they are moved.\n\nTo set up a redirect:\n\nHow many links do you need created?\n  - **A single link**: Submit a [Marketing Asana Ticket](https://form.asana.com/?k=AYDfCAlUYXPLy0bAlaFWJg&d=279683980846511) for your request. Please specify the in-product link in the form `https://mattermost.com/pl/<default-page-name>/`, and the destination URL.\n  - **Multiple links**: If you need more than a single link, enter the routes and corresponding destination URLs in the [Product Linkout Redirects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O601H_A0IM8pR3FOfue29_C8flGV7xK3ts-tJUVDHHg/edit#gid=607040777) spreadsheet, on the **Requests** tab. Then submit a [Marketing Asana Ticket](https://form.asana.com/?k=AYDfCAlUYXPLy0bAlaFWJg&d=279683980846511) for your link requests. Just let us know you've put entries in the request tab (if there's other requests in there, please let us know the rows you're referring to).\n\nMarketing will notify you when your request is complete, and will update the spreadsheet (add your links to the correct tabs).\n\n#### For a Marketing team member who adds the redirect, follow these steps:\n\nIf the destination URL has a hash (ex. `https://destination.com/example-slug#anchor`), follow the directions for Yoast, otherwise, use WPEngine.\n\n#### WPEngine\n1. Login into the User Portal.\n2. Go to the production mattermost.com instance in the dashboard and find the **Redirect rules** link.\n3. Click the **New redirect rule** button in the top-right corner of the page.\n4. You do not need to enter a name for the redirect.\n5. For the **Domain** field, choose `mattermost.com`.\n6. For the **Source** field, enter the new direct you want to use in-product in the format of `^/pl/default-page-description/?$`.\n7. For the **Destination** field, enter the full destination URL.\n8. Open the **Advanced Settings** dropdown and for the **Type**:\n  - Choose `301` \\(this is the default option\\) if the destination is unlikely to change.\n  - Choose `302` if the destination could change. Browsers will cache and not pick up the change for a while if you set it to `301`.\n9. Click the **Save** button. Your new entry will be located at the bottom of the list.\n10. Test your redirect URL. This will be the URL in the format of `https://mattermost.com/pl/default-page-description`.\n\n#### Yoast\n1. Log in to the administration panel for https://mattermost.com/.\n2. From the left-hand sidebar, go to **SEO > Redirects**.\n3. On the top of the screen, ensure you are on the **Redirects - Yoast SEO** page header on the **Regex Redirects** tab.\n4. Picking the redirect **Type**\n  - Choose `301` \\(this is the default option\\) if the destination is unlikely to change.\n  - Choose `302` if the destination could change. Browsers will cache and not pick up the change for a while if you set it to `301`.\n5. In the **Old url** field, enter in the new direct you want to use in-product in the format of `^\\/pl/default-page-description\\/?(\\?.+)?$`. Update the page description with your page information.\n6. In the **Url** field, enter in the full URL with a `$1` right before the hash (ex. `https://docs.mattermost.com/example-slug$1#report-a-bug`).\n  - This is so any URL params get placed in the right spot so the anchor behavior remains. \n7. Click the **Add Redirect** botton and verify your entry is added to the list. You may need to page through to find your entry.\n8. Test your redirect URL. This will be the URL in the format of `https://mattermost.com/pl/default-page-description`.\n",

        "content": "# Cloud and Self-Hosted Release Process\n\nMattermost core team works on a monthly release process, with a new version of cloud and self-hosted shipping successively once a month.\n\nThis document outlines the development process for the Mattermost core team, which draws from what we find works best for us from Agile, Scrum, and Software Development Lifecycle approaches. Please refer to [the cloud & self-hosted release playbook](https://community.mattermost.com/playbooks/playbooks/7ya8gsijg3f1dkx84txzek6t1r/outline) for the release checklist.\n\nA single release is qualified for both cloud and self-hosted at the same time, with both versions labelled as ``vX.Y.Z``. Outside of patch releases, no changes are released to self-hosted customers before they are first released to cloud customers.\n\n## Release Timeline\n\nNote: T-minus counts are measured in \"working days\" \\(weekdays, Monday through Friday, excluding [the listed statutory holidays](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/paid-time-off#holidays)\\) prior to release day.\n\n - Feature Complete and Release Branch Cut at T-24\n    - All major features must be complete and merged approximately five weeks prior to the self-managed release date. Prior to this day, the release manager makes sure everyone is aware of the impending deadline by posting reminders in the ``Release Announcements`` and ``Release: Self-Hosted & Cloud`` channels and messaging team leads. If any pull requests are not merged by this date, then the release manager changes release milestones in Jira after checking with team leads that those features can be pushed to a future release. Updates to prepackaged plugins should also be complete and merged by this date, with room to address bugs before code freeze. This is also the date when the ``release-X.Y`` branch is cut from master. Any additional changes to the release must first be merged to master before being cherry-picked to ``release-X.Y``. All test servers are configured to update daily from this branch.\n\n - Judgment Day at T-19\n    - Approximately one week after feature complete, the release manager reviews the status of all features and issues. Regression bugs are identified naturally in Community as well as on the release branch by the QA team. If anything needs to be cut, the Release Manager informs internal stakeholders in the ``Release: Self-Hosted & Cloud`` channel and asks the feature owners to revert the code. There should be no known major issues included with the release. A feature should be reverted if any [Severity 1](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/development-process/new-bug-tickets/bug-severity-guidelines) blockers or more than five Severity 2 issues found. RC-1 is cut on this day.\n\n - Release Qualification Starts at T-18\n    - Immediately after judgment day and any reverts are completed, the release team officially begins release qualification. This includes verifying and closing tickets resolved for the release; running Rainforest release test run groups, Cypress automated tests, and release smoke tests; executing manual tests; and triaging new issues and re-testing as fixes become available. Progress is tracked in the [QA Approval playbook](https://community.mattermost.com/playbooks/playbooks/rpsa3y78t3gsun9ba8185s5gto/outline). Qualifying any individual issue occurs in both self-hosted and cloud test servers simultaneously, as the same artifacts will ship unchanged into each environment.\n\n - Code Freeze at T-10\n    - Ten business days prior to the release date, and near to the end of release qualification, code freeze prohibits all further changes to the release branch. No further code changes will be accepted, preventing last-minute regressions, fixes, and additional testing. A final release build is cut and pushed to https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost, but marked as pre-release. The delivery team continues to triage and push minor bugs to the next release.\n    - If a showstopper issue is found, a patch release is required that may risk the remaining milestone dates. Minor bugs or issues found after code freeze should generally be deferred to the next release, but it is occasionally necessary to patch the monthly release to address show stopper bugs or security issues. Introducing a patch increments the patch version (``vX.Y.Z+1``) and may delay the cloud or self-hosted release dates. We bump the patch version here to preserve the integrity of the code freeze deadline. We also schedule a retrospective to better understand how the issue was introduced and discovered so late in the release cycle.\n\n - Release Approval at T-8\n    - Approximately two weeks after starting release qualification, the delivery team formally signs off on the complete release qualification.\n\n - Cloud Beta Release at T-7\n   - The qualified release is rolled out to the cloud beta production servers for final QA smoke testing.\n\n - Cloud Freemium Release at T-6\n   - After final QA release approval, the release is rolled out to the freemium ring.\n\n - Cloud Professional Release at T-5\n   - Two business days after soaking in cloud beta, the release is rolled out to customers in the professional ring.\n\n - Cloud Enterprise Release T-3\n   - Once stabilized in cloud professional, the release is rolled out to customers in the enterprise ring. The actual date may be two or three business days later to avoid releasing to enterprise customers on a Friday.\n\n - Cloud Dedicated Release at T-2\n    - Once stabilized in cloud enterprise, the release is rolled out to enterprise customers with dedicated clusters. As with T-3, the actual date may be one or two business days later to avoid releasing to dedicated customers on a Friday.\n\n - Self-Managed Release at T-0\n    - On the first business day on or before the 16th of the month, the same build already qualified in cloud is released for self-hosted customers. No rebuild is required. Marketing communications begin to roll out, and the release is communicated on the blog and other marketing channels. The pre-release bit on the corresponding GitHub release is manually removed. Note that this may be ``vX.Y.1`` or a later patch release if fixes were required after code freeze. Release documentation, including the changelog, is merged on this day.\n",

        "title": "Release Overview",
        "content": "# Release Overview\n\nMattermost ships with a new version once a month for both cloud and self-hosted customers.\n\n## Release numbering\n\nMattermost numbers stable releases in the following format: **\\[Major Build Number\\].\\[Minor Build Number\\].\\[Patch Build Number\\]**\n\n**Major build number:**\n\n* Purpose: Major system releases introduce significantly new functionality or change existing product behavior\n* Release frequency: Once a year. Major system releases are infrequent\n* Example: v1.x.x, v2.x.x\n\n**Minor build number:**\n\n* Purpose: Introduce new features, bug fixes and performance improvements\n* Release frequency: Monthly cadence\n* Example: v1.2.x, v1.4.x\n\n**Patch build number:**\n\n* Purpose: Patch existing releases when severe bug fixes or security patches are required\n* Release frequency: As required\n* Example: v1.2.5, v1.2.6\n\n## Objectives\n\nThe goal is to deliver value to users quickly by a\\) shipping fast to get features to customers quickly for experimentation/feedback, and b\\) iteratively behind feature flags as a protection if any issues arise. This document outlines the principles and guidelines for how we release a new update of each product line on a monthly basis.\n\n## Release Principles\n\n1. **Focus on High Impact by shipping every new feature and any riskier code changes behind a feature flag**\n   * Each development team is individually responsible for quality and deciding if a feature should be included in a release or not \\(with the release team giving guidelines\\). This may mean shipping more patch releases, but we can manage some of this by using feature flags. This also requires good test automation coverage.\n2. **Automate**\n   * Automate release processes and tasks.\n   * Automate release tests and have E2E tests for features.\n3. **Earn Trust by communicating to external and internal stakeholders clearly**\n   * Enables us to make expectations for releases clear for all stakeholders.\n   * Make expectations for each release clear \\(release dates, etc.\\). Communicate. Ensure that everyone on the team is familiar with the release processes.\n   * Release notes, minimum version requirements, and any important upgrade notes need to be available for customers and communicated via docs, blog, emails, and channels.\n4. **Earn Trust by including all stakeholders \\(Tech Writers, Marketing, QA, etc.\\) early in the release process**\n   * Enables us to avoid missing key tasks and to avoid last minute work.\n   * E.g. When opening a PR, add a \u201cDocs/Needed\u201d label for any PRs that need docs and communicate to Tech Writers. This ensures that we have time to complete docs on time.\n   * Make tracking bugs and testing requirements easy. E.g:\n     * Resolve Jira tickets for QA when PRs are merged (and cherry-picked).\n     * Add QA test steps to Jira tickets and/or PRs.\n     * Add Fix Versions and Milestones in Jira/PRs for bugs/tickets for easy tracking.\n     * Add clear Release Notes on PRs.\n5. **Achieve Customer Obsession by doing retrospectives on release issues and monitoring customer/community release bug reports after releases**\n   * This allows us to learn from issues so that they don\u2019t happen again and to fix critical bugs asap.\n   * Retrospectives for issues and dot releases are important.\n   * Monitor community and customer reports in GitHub, Forum, and channels like Ask R&D, in partnership with the Support team.\n\n## Release Cycles\n\nWe follow [the Agile Release Train method](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/agile-release-train/). If releases are not approved by a certain date, then we miss the release train.\n\n - Cloud/self-hosted [release process is outlined here](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/release-process/feature-release).\n - [Mobile app](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/release-process/mobile-release) releases follow the same release cadence as cloud/self-hosted.\n - [Desktop app release process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/release-process/desktop-release).\n - When issues are found that warrant a patch release, we follow the [dot release process outlined here](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/release-process/dot-release).\n\n## Release dates communication\n\nRelease dates are currently communicated in the following ways.\n\n1. Channels\n   * The [Release Announcements channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/release-announcements) functions as the main location for important announces about Cloud test server updates, and for release dates and feature complete deadlines. Specific teams or people may be at-mentioned if the announce is targeted at someone.\n   * The [Announcements channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/announcements) functions as the central place to find the most important announcements for new releases with links to changelogs and/or blog posts that can be easily shared with external stakeholders including MLT and customers.\n2. Mattermost Release Dates Calendar\n   * Lists key release dates and deadlines.\n3. PM and R&D meetings\n   * Updates are provided on upcoming key dates and/or features as needed.\n4. Productboard\n   * [Productboard](https://mattermost.productboard.com/data/releases) - A milestone overview of what releases + features are coming up.\n5. Spreadsheet\n   * [Overview of release deadlines and cherry-picking guidelines](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jGEnuaZxosmC-JSUXFeZOR7I34ORFtNjPVw8hvzCIC4/edit#gid=0).\n\n## Plugin Release Processes\n - The sample [Plugin Release Playbook](https://community.mattermost.com/playbooks/playbooks/f4oh16ardfbyfgkas1cb6intmw/outline) helps give an overview of needed steps for plugin releases.\n\n## Tracking feature flags\n\nDetails on feature flags: [https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/server/feature-flags/](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/server/feature-flags/).\n\n## Adding milestones on PRs and Jira tickets\n\n* If the PR is scheduled for a specific Mattermost release, please add the `Cherry-pick Approved` label and self-managed milestone on the PR. The Release Manager keeps track of PRs with the `Cherry-pick Approved` label and self-managed milestone on a daily basis.\n* The Release Manager also tracks regression bugs and aims to ensure that they get fixed for the next release.\n* A fix version is added in Jira to track regression bug fixes for Mattermost releases.\n\n## Triaging Mattermost customer issues\n\nWhen triaging a bug report, consider the following:\n\n* Impact of the bug on customers.\n* Severity of the issue.\n* Risk and effort of reverting to the last version or fixing a bug.\n\n**Criteria**\n\n1. \"We need to revert to the last version\" process:\n   * Crash or all services are down due to a bug; affects some to all Mattermost Cloud customers.\n2. \"We need to release this ASAP\" process:\n   * A severe regression or loss of functionality; affects some to all Cloud customers.\n3. \"It's OK to wait until next release\" process:\n   * Loss of function, but little impact on Cloud customers.\n\n**Responders**\n\n* Who is making the decision on which process above we need to follow?\n  * In some cases it's the customer support teams or Cloud teams, and in some cases it's other people such as the Release Manager or developers who notice or get notified about the report.\n* Bugs will be fixed by either the CRE team or by respective development teams, depending on availability and expertise.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Q: What is the release cycle for the React Native mobile apps?**\n\n* A: The mobile apps follow the same monthly release cycle as Mattermost Server/Webapp, releasing on the 16th of each month.\n\n**Q: What is the release cycle for the Mattermost Desktop app?**\n\n* A: Desktop releases are shipped every 3 months starting in March, 2023. For more details, see https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/release-process/desktop-release.\n\n**Q: When do I need to have a feature PR to be included into the next release?**\n\n* A: Aim to have the PR merged before the Feature Complete deadline. The earlier in the monthly cycle the PR is merged, the higher the chances are for it to be included in that month's release. The quality of our releases is important and feature PRs are not normally cherry-picked to a release branch.\n\n**Q: How can I determine if my merge request will make it into the next release?**\n\n* A: The Release Manager adds PR milestones and Jira fix versions for tracking. You can also check the release branches (e.g. in the mattermost repo) to see what's included.\n\n**Q: Do we use Playbooks for releases?**\n\n* A: Yes, playbooks are used for cloud & self-hosted, mobile and desktop releases, and for dot releases and plugin releases.\n\n**Q: How are PRs merged for release?**\n\n* A: PRs are first merged to master. As needed, the dev who submitted the fix is also responsible for cherry-picking it to the release branch after a release branch has been cut.\n\n**Q: How is cherry-picking done?**\n\n* A: See the [cherry pick process documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/branching/#cherry-pick-process-developer/) for details.\n\n**Q: What version is community.mattermost.com kept on?**\n\n* A: Normally on `master` branch and it updates daily.\n\n**Q: How to remove a feature/bug from a release?**\n\n* A: The feature flag is turned off. Another option is reverting the feature from the `master` and `release` branches.\n\n**Q: How are NOTICE.txt PRs submitted?**\n\n* A: PRs are first merged to `master`. The dev reviewer is responsible for helping cherry-picking it to the `release` branch as needed.\n\n**Q: Is an improvement a feature or a bug?**\n\n* A: Usually features/story tickets.\n\n**Q: How does release team monitor what changes went into a release?**\n\n* A: Monitor the commit history of the respective `release` branch, e.g., [https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/commits/release-7.5](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/commits/release-7.5) contains commits that shipped with `mattermost-server v7.5`. Jira ticket is resolved after cherry picking is done.\n\n**Q: How does translations branching work?**\n\n* A: The translation PR will be submitted against the master branch.\n\n**Q: What is the process for community PRs?**\n\n* A: Review, merge, and cherry-pick as needed.\n\n**Q: What information does the Customer Support team need for Cloud releases?**\n\n* The Announcements channel in the Staff team is used for release updates and for posting the changelog.\n",
        "html": "<h1>Release Overview</h1>\n<p>Mattermost ships with a new version once a month for both cloud and self-hosted customers.</p>\n<h2>Release numbering</h2>\n<p>Mattermost numbers stable releases in the following format: <strong>[Major Build Number].[Minor Build Number].[Patch Build Number]</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Major build number:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Purpose: Major system releases introduce significantly new functionality or change existing product behavior</li>\n<li>Release frequency: Once a year. Major system releases are infrequent</li>\n<li>Example: v1.x.x, v2.x.x</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor build number:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Purpose: Introduce new features, bug fixes and performance improvements</li>\n<li>Release frequency: Monthly cadence</li>\n<li>Example: v1.2.x, v1.4.x</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Patch build number:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Purpose: Patch existing releases when severe bug fixes or security patches are required</li>\n<li>Release frequency: As required</li>\n<li>Example: v1.2.5, v1.2.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p>The goal is to deliver value to users quickly by a) shipping fast to get features to customers quickly for experimentation/feedback, and b) iteratively behind feature flags as a protection if any issues arise. This document outlines the principles and guidelines for how we release a new update of each product line on a monthly basis.</p>\n<h2>Release Principles</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Focus on High Impact by shipping every new feature and any riskier code changes behind a feature flag</strong></li>\n<li>Each development team is individually responsible for quality and deciding if a feature should be included in a release or not (with the release team giving guidelines). This may mean shipping more patch releases, but we can manage some of this by using feature flags. This also requires good test automation coverage.</li>\n<li><strong>Automate</strong></li>\n<li>Automate release processes and tasks.</li>\n<li>Automate release tests and have E2E tests for features.</li>\n<li><strong>Earn Trust by communicating to external and internal stakeholders clearly</strong></li>\n<li>Enables us to make expectations for releases clear for all stakeholders.</li>\n<li>Make expectations for each release clear (release dates, etc.). Communicate. Ensure that everyone on the team is familiar with the release processes.</li>\n<li>Release notes, minimum version requirements, and any important upgrade notes need to be available for customers and communicated via docs, blog, emails, and channels.</li>\n<li><strong>Earn Trust by including all stakeholders (Tech Writers, Marketing, QA, etc.) early in the release process</strong></li>\n<li>Enables us to avoid missing key tasks and to avoid last minute work.</li>\n<li>E.g. When opening a PR, add a \u201cDocs/Needed\u201d label for any PRs that need docs and communicate to Tech Writers. This ensures that we have time to complete docs on time.</li>\n<li>Make tracking bugs and testing requirements easy. E.g:<ul>\n<li>Resolve Jira tickets for QA when PRs are merged (and cherry-picked).</li>\n<li>Add QA test steps to Jira tickets and/or PRs.</li>\n<li>Add Fix Versions and Milestones in Jira/PRs for bugs/tickets for easy tracking.</li>\n<li>Add clear Release Notes on PRs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Achieve Customer Obsession by doing retrospectives on release issues and monitoring customer/community release bug reports after releases</strong></li>\n<li>This allows us to learn from issues so that they don\u2019t happen again and to fix critical bugs asap.</li>\n<li>Retrospectives for issues and dot releases are important.</li>\n<li>Monitor community and customer reports in GitHub, Forum, and channels like Ask R&amp;D, in partnership with the Support team.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Release Cycles</h2>\n<p>We follow <a href=\"https://www.scaledagileframework.com/agile-release-train/\">the Agile Release Train method</a>. If releases are not approved by a certain date, then we miss the release train.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cloud/self-hosted <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/release-process/feature-release\">release process is outlined here</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/release-process/mobile-release\">Mobile app</a> releases follow the same release cadence as cloud/self-hosted.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/release-process/desktop-release\">Desktop app release process</a>.</li>\n<li>When issues are found that warrant a patch release, we follow the <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/release-process/dot-release\">dot release process outlined here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Release dates communication</h2>\n<p>Release dates are currently communicated in the following ways.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Channels</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/release-announcements\">Release Announcements channel</a> functions as the main location for important announces about Cloud test server updates, and for release dates and feature complete deadlines.

        "content": "# How to Update Integrations Directory\n\nThis document outlines the internal process for updating [https://integrations.mattermost.com/](https://integrations.mattermost.com/). New integrations get submitted in the [Integrations and Apps channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/integrations) via [this form](https://spinpunch.wufoo.com/forms/mattermost-integrations-and-installers/).\n\n## Initial steps\n\n1. Go to [https://mmapps.wpengine.com/wp-login.php](https://mmapps.wpengine.com/wp-login.php) and log in with your account. If you don\u2019t have an account, ask Marketing for access.\n2. Navigate to **Posts** on the left hand sidebar.\n3. To add a new integration select **Add New**.\n\n## Integration elements\n\nThe following includes guidelines for specific elements of an integration.\n\n### Title\n\nShort title of the integration, effectively its name. Examples:\n\n* Facebook\n* Twitter\n* BigBlueButton Plugin\n\n**Note:** If the integration is a plugin, please include \u201cPlugin\u201d in the title.\n\nTo confirm whether an integration is a plugin, check its install instructions to see what it refers to. For example, if it says to configure it as a webhook in Mattermost and as a plugin in Jenkins, it's a plugin in Jenkins, not in Mattermost.\n\n**Note:** If it's an Amazon-related integration, include both the official and short form in the title. For example \"Amazon AWS SNS Plugin\".\n\n### Description\n\nInclude a short description of the integration, typically provided by the integration creator. You can also usually find a description of the integration on the GitHub project.\n\n**Note:** Don\u2019t end the description with a period.\n\n### Author\n\nThis is the GitHub author of the integration. Depending on the details in their GitHub profile this should always be a full name or a company name. If neither a full name or a company name is public on their GitHub profile, using their GitHub username is also fine.\n\n### Language\n\nThis is the programming language of the integration.\n\nYou can find this by clicking on the colored bar in the GitHub project, below the header containing **Commits**, **Branches**, **Releases**, **Contributors**, and choose the language\\(s\\) higher than 30%.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Don't add \"Makefile\" unless it's the only language on the repo.\n* Use \"Go\" instead of \"Golang\".\n* If there is no language, set to \"N/A\" instead of leaving it blank.\n\n### License\n\nThis is typically found in the GitHub project, on the file named \u201cLICENSE\u201d. The license file should specify the license type.\n\n**Note:** License must be compatible with [Apache 2.0](https://apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a) \\(e.g. not GPLv3, nor APGLv3\\). If it's not compatible with Apache 2.0, do not add the integration to the website.\n\nFor formatting, write \"Apache 2.0\", \"BSD 2-Clause\" or \"BSD 3-Clause\".\n\nWhen the integration is not open source, mark the license as \"N/A - not open source\".\n\n### Download URL\n\nLink to the README file on the GitHub project which typically includes install instructions.\n\n### Source code URL\n\nLink to their GitHub repo.\n\n### Date Published\n\nTypically found in the GitHub project by selecting the **Releases** tab in the header. Navigate to the oldest release, and use its date as the **Date Published** field. If there are no releases, go to the **Contributors** tab in the header, and select the start date as the **Date Published** field.\n\n### Categories\n\nChoose the categories you feel best fit the integration. If you\u2019re uncertain, compare what categories are used by Slack, Atlassian, and/or Salesforce \\(see list below\\). If you're still uncertain, ask the Integrations PM.\n\n* [https://marketplace.atlassian.com/](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/)\n* [https://slack.com/apps](https://slack.com/apps)\n* [https://appexchange.salesforce.com/](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/)\n\n### Featured image\n\nThis is a logo of the integration, e.g. Facebook logo for Facebook integration.\n\nUse Twitter to find official logos if none are provided by the integration creator. If there is no good icon/logo to use, go to [https://mattermost.wayfx.com/0ddc9bpne/p/45193](https://mattermost.wayfx.com/0ddc9bpne/p/45193) and choose an icon that best fits the integration type.\n\nUse an icon that's at least 80x80px in size.\n\n### Date last updated\n\nCheck the date of \"Last Commit\" on the repository.\n\n## Guidelines\n\n1. License of the integration must be compatible with [Apache 2.0](https://apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a) \\(e.g. not GPLv3 or APGLv3\\). The only exception is if the integration is not open source.\n2. The integration must have been updated in the last 12 months.\n3. Every integration link must be related to Mattermost. Especially if the integration is not open source, it should be obvious to users that it's related to Mattermost.\n\n## Marketing\n\n* Add integration/plugin creators to changelog\u2019s list of contributors.\n  * For example: For March release, add any new ones from February.\n* Post a tweet for all new integrations.\n  * For example: [https://twitter.com/Mattermost/status/1102709312231596032](https://twitter.com/Mattermost/status/1102709312231596032).\n\n## Announcement\n\n1. Once the integration entry has been added to the directory, please reply back in the Integrations channel with a screenshot of the entry that was added, a link to its install guide, and an at-mention for the Integrations PM. Example:\n\n```text\n[@-username] Standup Raven Plugin added to https://integrations.mattermost.com\n\nhttps://github.com/standup-raven/standup-raven/blob/master/README.md\n\n[Attached image]\n```\n\n1. Once the Integrations PM has acknowledged, please re-post to [Announcements channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/announcements).\n\n## Release date T-0\n\n1. Add integrations with more than 50 stars to the \u201cNew and Noteworthy\u201d category.\n2. Add 8 most recent integrations to the \u201cNew and Noteworthy\u201d category. The oldest on this list should be removed when a new integration is added.\n3. Update the Date Last Updated for all integrations.\n4. Remove any integrations that haven\u2019t been updated in the last 12 months.\n   * **Note:** Keep this relaxed. Some older ones are still important to keep.\n5. Ask the Integrations PM if any integrations are good to add or remove from the \"Staff Picks\" section.\n\n**Note:** These integrations should be kept in the \"New and Noteworthy\" category:\n\n* [https://www.pagerduty.com/docs/guides/mattermost-integration-guide/](https://www.pagerduty.com/docs/guides/mattermost-integration-guide/)\n* [https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1215055/slack-for-confluence?hosting=cloud&tab=overview](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1215055/slack-for-confluence?hosting=cloud&tab=overview)\n* [https://github.com/cpanato/mattermost-plugin-statuspage](https://github.com/cpanato/mattermost-plugin-statuspage)\n* [https://github.com/Lujeni/matterllo](https://github.com/Lujeni/matterllo)\n* [https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/mattermost-integration](https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/mattermost-integration)\n* [https://github.com/blindsidenetworks/mattermost-plugin-bigbluebutton](https://github.com/blindsidenetworks/mattermost-plugin-bigbluebutton)\n* [https://github.com/cvitter/mattermost-bitbucket-bridge](https://github.com/cvitter/mattermost-bitbucket-bridge)\n* [https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge)\n* [https://github.com/loafoe/hubot-matteruser](https://github.com/loafoe/hubot-matteruser)\n* [https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-github](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-github)\n* [https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-bot-sample-golang](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-bot-sample-golang)\n* [https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jira](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jira)\n* [https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-zoom](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-zoom)\n\n",

This is used to help identify customer problems, wants/needs, feature shortcomings, and any other areas for improvement that stem from interacting with customers. Essentially, think of this as a place to communicate the most important takeaways from customers that the Product team can help you with.\n\nNotes from customer calls should be filed in [Salesforce](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Ilm0t8AUtjtOociqUYuLluuT4lxcDijaiIrZ8wcamJE/edit?ts=5e6f6c50). This automatically pushes the customer call notes into the Mattermost \u201cCustomer Feedback\u201d channel for visibility, and also to Productboard so it can be processed by PMs.\n\nImportant points about notes:\n\n* Notes are specific to a customer/prospect.\n* Notes can include multiple requests \\(Product Managers can apply multiple elements from the note to different features if necessary\\).\n* If you're not sure if the request or feedback should apply to an existing feature, you can simply capture the feedback as a note, assign it to the Product Manager overseeing that area, or leave it unassigned.\n\nWhen filing a note in Productboard: \n1. Add a title to the note that summarizes the problem, not the solution. \n2. Add the customer name. \n3. Add as much detail about the request and/or feedback as possible. \n4. (Optional) Add the PM owner as Assignee if you know it. If not, no worries.\n\nSample questions to answer:\n\n* What problem are they trying to solve? What's their specific use case?\n* How are they solving the problem right now? How is the current solution working or not working for them?\n* How is this problem affecting their business and users?\n* What's the priority for them? Is getting a solution a blocker, a must-have, or a nice-to-have?\n\n\n### Adding feedback \\(via Chrome extension\\)\n\nUsing the official [Productboard Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/productboard-make-product/mlpbdkpkicfkhgagnoamdcimmhdkakni) you can add notes from any page within Chrome \\(including SFDC, Zendesk, GitHub, HackerNews, Mattermost web, etc.\\) and streamline your workflow dramatically.\n\nAs long as you are logged into Productboard, the connectivity to the Mattermost insights board is secure and seamless.\n\n![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/productboard-chrome-extension.png)\n\n**Pro tip**: If you keep your call notes in a browser app \\(such as Google Docs\\), you can highlight the sections related to feedback and quickly send them over to productboard with the extension.\n\n### Adding insights directly to an existing feature\n\nYou also have access to view [Features](https://mattermost.productboard.com/feature-board/1097524-master-feature-list) from the Master Features view or from Roadmaps. You can search and browse all features and ideas and even read the notes and portal cards from Product Managers for a detailed description of the feature/idea. In the case of planned features, you'll have complete insight into the status of the feature and a rough idea of where it sits on the roadmap.\n\nWithin the detailed view of individual features, you can view the full list of insights added by other Product Managers, Customer Success Managers, Customer Engineers, or Support Engineers. You also have the option to add insight directly to the feature itself.\n\n![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/productboard-insights-master-feature-list.png)\n\n## Insights Processing\n\nNew feedback from users and customers is sent to the [Insights Board](https://mattermost.productboard.com/insights). Typically these are submitted by fellow Product Managers, Support, Customer Success Managers, or Sales through integrations with email, Zapier, Zendesk, or others.\n\nInsights are processed by Product Managers on a weekly basis. When a new Insights is submitted in Productboard, it is also posted to the Product Management: Private channel via a Zapier integration. \n\nWhen a PM processes an Insight, they will attach the relevant information to an existing or new feature. New features are entered as \u201cideas\u201d. One Insight might contain links to multiple features, you can see the highlight and a pencil icon which will show what feature the note is attached to.\n\n![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2857%29.png)\n\n\n![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/productboard-link-feedback.png)\n\n## Features\n\n### Stay up to date on feature status updates\n\nStaying informed of status changes and comments on a feature is easy in Productboard:\n\n1. Locate the feature on the [Master Feature list](https://mattermost.productboard.com/feature-board/1097524-master-feature-list) or by searching on the Feature tab.\n2. Click on the feature name to open the feature details card.\n3. Add yourself as a follower by clicking on the **+** symbol in the bottom left corner of the feature details card.\n\n![add-followers2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20331166/83704445-f6be5d80-a5c6-11ea-9ce5-6daf1f7b55ac.png)\n\n[Learn more about Productboard notifications](https://help.productboard.com/en/articles/1252670-how-do-notifications-work).\n\n\n### Feature statuses\n\nFeatures default to \u201cidea\u201d when first created: \n\n   * **Idea**: When you have a single request or an idea for a feature it starts out in this status. As new customer insights come in, you'll be able to attach them to this idea to validate and measure demand.\n   * **Under Consideration**: This status is used to identify features that are demand validated, but we remain undecided if we'll build them \\(for various reasons\\).\n   * **Planned**: Features that we've validated and decided to build are planned. These features should all have a release assigned \\(if scheduling is unknown, assign to the release called **backlog**.\n   * **In Development**: All features actively being worked on by UX or R&D belong to this status.\n   * **Postponed**: If a feature is cut from a release, followers of the feature need to be notified. Currently, productboard only notifies followers when a status changes or they're explicitly mentioned. We have added this status to ensure followers of a feature can stay informed when features are cut.\n   * **Won't Do**: This is a status often used after the **Under Consideration** status if we decide for any reason not to build a feature that's demanded by the market. It's important to keep track of for future cases of demand. If you set a feature to this status, please be sure to provide the reason we won't do it. This reason should be in a format that can be shared with propspects/customers.\n",

        "content": "# How to Write a Feature Release Announcement\n\nThis document outlines how to write a release announcement and release tweets for a feature. These are used at the release day in our release newsletter and Twitter.\n\nEach Product Manager is responsible for writing a release announcement for every feature, integration, or announcement they want included in the release newsletter.\n\n[Here is an example of a previously completed release announcement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BqgLFqvpYJFm6TfrqkCUyYIs666BL1nawpgw6a4CpGA/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n## Overview\n\nIt's important to think of the release announcement as a press release. We're communicating changes to our current and prospective customers so we want it to be exciting as well as informative. The release announcement is a coordinated document, with each Product Manager contributing their own features as sub-headings. The headline and first paragraph will be written by PM leads and the CPO after all other features have been provided.\n\n**Note:** Consider using this information in productboard for your features to validate the messaging and to keep consistency across channels.\n\n### Timeline\n\nA release announcement for each feature should be started early in the product planning process. Each Product Manager is directly responsible for writing the announcement for each of their features. For large product features or new products, a PRFAQ should be completed. For smaller features, a \u201cmini-PRFAQ\u201d should be completed in the form of a blog post.

Bumping, tagging, releasing, publishing, and bundling \\(preloading\\) versions are not necessarily complicated, but a formal set of steps is required and should be followed. This document describes those processes in detail and will be used to help standardize and automate these flows in the future.\n\n## Goals\n\n1. Define the steps required to bump, tag, release, publish, and bundle plugin versions.\n2. Through defining specific tasks during the process we will be able to define protocols and identify areas for automation improvements.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis document covers the current steps required to perform the following tasks:\n\n1. Bump the current version of an existing plugin.\n2. Tag a version of a plugin for release.\n3. Bundle a plugin version to a Mattermost server release.\n4. Publish a bumped plugin version to the Plugin Marketplace.\n5. Publish a new plugin to the Plugin Marketplace.\n6. Release to `community.mattermost.com`.\n\nThe Future Enhancements section of this document describes additional suggestions for automating some of these tasks.\n\n## Plugin release flows\n\n### Considerations when bumping and releasing a plugin version\n\n* Compare commits from last bump/tagged release.\n* Documentation changes aren\u2019t necessarily vital.\n  * Documentation through bundled releases aren\u2019t viewable through the app and users will be looking at the latest master commit in the GitHub repo.\n* The PR for the version bump \\(in the plugin repo\\) does not mean that is the last commit to get tagged. This step only bumps the version. The tagging step actually determines the commit that is tagged with the release tag.\n\n### Create release issue\n\n* Create an issue on the corresponding repository to track the whole release process.\n  * **Title:** `Release vX.Y.Z`\n  * **Summary:** Add every outstanding PR or issue as a [task list item](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-task-lists).\n* Assign yourself to the issue.\n* Add `Type/Task` label.\n* Add that issue to the [Plugin Releases board](https://github.com/orgs/mattermost/projects/2) in `Code Changes Needed`.\n* Once every code change for the release has been merged, move the issue to `Release in Review` and open a version bump PR.\n\n### Create version bump PR\n\n* Feature or patch bumping determined by commits being added from previous release tag.\n* Look through existing Issues and PRs and make sure the Milestone label is added for items to be included with release.\n* Verify no existing security issues \\(using [Updating Security Alerts Through CLI](plugin-release-process.md#updating-security-alerts-through-cli)\\).\n  * If security issues exist, submit PR and merge before bumping version.\n* Install/Update [`pluginops`](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-utilities/tree/master/pluginops).\n* Run `pluginops release` inside a local copy of the repository.\n* Follow the steps of the tool.\n* Once the local changes are done, follow the link to open a PR.\n* Add any further reasoning or description for version bump \\(if necessary\\).\n* Add 2 Developers and 1 QA for review.\n* You might also add a PM review to verify the release from a PM perspective.\n\n### Tag/cut a version of a plugin for release\n\nAfter the PR for bumping the version of a plugin has been merged, you can now tag the version for release.\n\n**Prerequesite:** In order to cut releases using matterbuild slash commands, you need to add your name and userID on the Community server to `AllowedUsers` and `ReleaseUsers` in [`config.json`](https://github.com/mattermost/platform-private/blob/master/matterbuild/config.json).\n\nCut the release using the following as an example. Note this is a slash command for use inside Mattermost:\n\n`/mb cutplugin --tag v1.2.0 --repo mattermost-plugin-todo`\n\nCI runs can be viewed at [circleci.com/gh/mattermost](https://circleci.com/gh/mattermost). If CI jobs complete successfully, a new release will automatically be produced and viewable under the **Releases** tab in the plugin repo.\n\nMatterbuild will respond with message upon success. Now view the release link and update the commit messages. This is a subjective task where determine if a commit is a feature of enhancement. Edit the release messages and arrange accordingly.\n\n**Only** close the release issue if the release shouldn't go into the Marketplace. Otherwise keep it open until the release is available in the Marketplace and move it to `Submitted to Marketplace`.\n\nThe next steps are to add the plugin to the Plugin Marketplace. The instructions are included in the return message upon a successful `cutplugin` command.\n\n### Bundle a plugin release version to a Mattermost server release\n\nPlugins that are released with Mattermost are called bundled plugins. These plugins are included with the software and need only to be configured.\n\n* `git pull` the latest master branch on mattermost-server\n* Create a new branch so you can modify the plugin versions\n  * `git checkout -b bundle-plugins-v5.20`\n  * Use branch naming convention `bundle-plugins-vX.XX`\n* Edit `Makefile`\n  * Locate `# Plugins Packages` comment\n  * Modify plugin release versions\n* Create PR against master branch with following:\n  * **Title:** `Update bundled plugins for vX.XX`\n  * **Summary:** List of updated plugins\n    * Ideally includes `from version` &gt; `to version` for each plugin\n\n### Publish a plugin release version to the Plugin Marketplace\n\nThe steps to have a plugin version added the Plugin Marketplace are included with the success of an `/mb cutplugin` slash command.\n\n### Release to `community.mattermost.com`\n\nOnce the Plugin Marketplace PR is merged, request an update on the plugin in the `~community-configuration`\\[[https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/community-configuration](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/community-configuration)\\] channel.\n\nThen close the release issue.\n\n## Security upgrade process\n\n\\(**`TODO`**: Automate checking all released plugins through CLI, cron, or GH webhook event\\)  \n\\(**`TODO`**: User must be repo admin to see and resolve automated security issue\\)  \n\\(**`TODO`**: Need method to hook to tell us when security issue is found\\)  \n\\(**`TODO`**: PR for security updates should be discrete\\)  \n\\(**`TODO`**: investigate `npm ls`\\)\n\nSecurity alerts are displayed when viewing a GitHub repo and are resolved via the automated `dependabot` tool\n\n### Updating npm dependencies CLI\n\n* `git checkout latest master`\n* `git checkout -b bump-dependency-versions`\n* `cd webapp/`\n  * `npm-check -E -u` to view the changes interactively\n\n    `npm-check -E -y` to update without interactive\n* `git add package-lock.json package-lock.json`\n* `git commit -m \"Update dependencies\"`\n* `git push --set-upstream origin bump-dependency-versions`\n* Create PR\n  * Title: `Update Dependencies` \\(Will automatically get set\\)\n  * Summary: Update dependencies\n\n### Updating security alerts through CLI\n\n* `git checkout latest master`\n* `git checkout -b npm-audit-fix`\n* `cd webapp/`\n* `npm audit` - will return list of security issues\n* `npm audit fix` - updates `package-lock.json` dependencies\n* `git add package-lock.json`\n* `git commit -m \"Update dependencies\"`\n* `git push --set-upstream origin npm-audit-fix`\n* Create PR\n  * Title: `Update Dependencies` \\(Will automatically get set\\)\n  * Summary: :  -&gt; \n\n### Updating security alerts through GitHub\n\nGitHub displays security alerts when viewing a GitHub repo.\n\n![Security Notification](../../../.gitbook/assets/security-notification.png)\n\nView all alerts by clicking on the **View security alerts** button.\n\n![Security Alerts](../../../.gitbook/assets/security-view-alerts.png)\n\nClicking on a specific security alert will open the details alert and provide a **Create automated security update** button.

Metrics updates: 2 min presentation on interesting metrics on [https://mattermost.looker.com](https://mattermost.looker.com).\n2. [Plugin Release Updates](https://github.com/orgs/mattermost/projects/1): Was did we ship in the last sprint? What do we want to ship in the next 4 weeks? What are blockers for that?\n3. Thursday R&D Demo: Decide what to demo.\n4. Guilds Updates: Short update from every guild meeting. If there isn't anything relevant, skip to the guild.\n5. Triage Jira Toolkit, Jira Integrations, and GitHub.\n6. Go through queued meeting items.\n7. \\(Optional\\) Quick stand up using [the GitHub board](https://github.com/orgs/mattermost/projects/1) and Jira.\n8. Remove all `Done` items from both GitHub boards.\n\n## QA testing\n\n* QA testing is require for all changes for not Beta plugin in the Marketplace.\n* QA testing may be shipped for Beta plugins.\n* QA testing is not required to changes that don't touch the production code of a plugin e.g. tooling changes.\n\n### Peer Testing Process\n\n1. Dylan will @-mention reviewers and request peer testing posting a link to the process.\n2. Using session-based testing example format provided developers will perform functional testing on the PR and take lightweight session notes. See example attached here: [https://mattermost.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/619937892/SampleSessionNotes.txt](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/619937892/SampleSessionNotes.txt).\n3. Once testing is done, developers will at mention Dylan in a comment and attach their session notes.\n4. Dylan will review session notes.\n5. As appropriate, Dylan will make updates to release testing based on functional changes or previously untested cases.\n6. Dylan will approve the PR for merge.\n7. Any functional changes will be included in the next end to end test on the version bump PR as usual.\n\n#### Things to be mindful of \\(WIP\\):\n\n* For visual changes, ensure that themes are properly applied.\n* When front end changes are made you should often test in desktop as well as browser as the JS is different.\n* Icons generated with system font can be different on from Mac to Windows.\n\n#### Testing notes example\n\n```text\nScope\n-----\n\n<!-- Your understanding of what functional impact the PR will have on the product -->\n\n- Display username that created zoom meeting #62.\n- Test that username of meeting creator is always shown.\n\nTesting notes\n-------------\n\n<!-- Testing you've done that you feel validate the change and cover any needed regression -->\n\n- User name is displayed in with Zoom meeting post as expected.\n- Tested switching mapped users to ensure display remains accurate.\n- Tested updating username to ensure display.\n- Trigger 30 second meeting collision post to ensure the functionality is also affected by the enhancement.\n\nFollow-up concerns\n-------------------\n\nSeeing an intermittent connection issue with Zoom on http://dkh-local.ngrok.io. Seems to occur on desktop.\n```\n\n## Ticket workflow\n\n### Jira\n\n* Jira tickets must be filed for:\n  * Planned changes in the core product \\(Server, Webapp, Mobile, Redux\\).\n  * Bugs in the core product \\(Server, Webapp, Mobile, Redux\\).\n* Jira ticket may be filled for larger multi-plugin projects.\n\n### GitHub\n\n* For all confirmed bugs a GitHub issue on the corresponding repository must be filed.\n* For all enhancements a GitHub issue on the corresponding repository should be filed.\n* Add a `Type/X` label to make clear what type the ticket is.\n* You may add a `Difficulty/X` label to set a mana estimate.\n  * `Easy` means 2 mana\n  * `Medium` means 4 mana\n  * `Hard` means 8 mana\n* Staff members add the issues there are working on for the current sprint to [https://github.com/orgs/mattermost/projects/1](https://github.com/orgs/mattermost/projects/1).\n  * Putting an issue is always preferred over putting a PR on the board.\n\n## Documentation process\n\n**1% draft**\n\nThis guide outlines the processes and workflows for requesting, updating, managing, and maintaining documentation for Mattermost-managed and community-managed apps, plugins, and integrations. This includes the branching strategy for the Gitbook repos, how to set up a new Gitbook, and the process for aligning documentation with releases.\n\nMattermost integrations documentation currently spans:\n\n* [docs.mattermost.com](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/integration.html): Outline of how integrations work with Mattermost and a list of integrations available.\n* Gitbook: Configuration and User documentation for plugins, as well as developer content.\n* developers.mattermost.com: Apps documentation, plugin documentation, introduction to the contribution process, contribution workflow, testing, and validation information.\n\nMattermost-managed integrations are maintained by Mattermost staff and the documentation is written and maintained by the Integrations team. Community-managed integrations are maintained by their creator, which includes documentation maintenance.\n\n## Apps documentation workflow\n\nThe Apps Framework and Marketplace documentation lives [here](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/apps/). When submitting documentation updates and new documentation for apps, there are two options available:\n\n1. Submit the content with your PR in the [plugin-apps](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-apps) repo. Add the `Docs/Needed` label to the PR and ping @justinegeffen. The content will then be added to the docs, and the `Docs/Done` label added to your PR.\n2. Alternatively, you're welcome \\(and encouraged\\) to submit the docs PR yourself, [here](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-developer-documentation/tree/master/site/content/integrate/apps), then add a `Docs/Needed` label and tag @justinegeffen.\n\nFor both options, please ensure that doc updates are either provided by you or requested ahead of merge so there's time to review the content. At least four days' notice is ideal. The goal is to ensure that docs and releases are always in sync.\n\n## Plugin documentation workflow\n\nThe plugin documentation will soon be moved to developers.mattermost.com and will follow the same process as above.

The main benefit of Kubernetes is being able to declaratively specify the resources you need and how much CPU and memory they require, and Kubernetes will figure out how to make it work. It will also attempt to restart VMs that have failed. We make use of [Dockerfiles](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/adovenmm/data-warehouse-psql/general) for our images. We also use [Bitnami\u2019s Airflow helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/airflow).\n* To keep our data and configuration confidential, we make use of [Kubernetes Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) which are only shared with team members who need access in LastPass.\n\n### Airflow\n\n* To access Airflow, you must be on VPN go to this [link](http://airflow.internal.mattermost.com). The Airflow Creds are stored in the Shared-BizOps LastPass folder.\n* [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) is a workflow orchestration tool built in Python that allows you to build and schedule [DAGs](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/concepts.html#dags). With these DAGs we can schedule jobs to run using [crontab style scheduling](https://crontab.guru/) and also declare dependencies between jobs so that we can ensure that data that we\u2019re processing doesn\u2019t get overwritten. Airflow also has great utilities for retrying failed jobs and alerting for job and DAG failures.\n* We take advantage of [Mattermost incoming webhooks](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/webhooks-incoming.html) to send DAG failures to a special internal Mattermost channel called BizOps where team members can triage the failure. We ensure that these get sent to Mattermost with our [failed task callback](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/dags/airflow_utils.py#L17) which is specified in each [DAGs configuration](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/dags/extract/diagnostics.py#L24).\n* We also utilize [Bitnami\u2019s Get DAG files from a git repository](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/airflow#option-3-get-your-dag-files-from-a-git-repository) to automatically pull from the master branch of our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse) every 60 seconds so our DAGs are always up to date.\n* We use Airflow\u2019s new [KubernetesPodOperator](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/kubernetes.html) that allows each of our jobs to run in its own Kubernetes Pod. The real flexibility with this is that because it\u2019s simply a Kubernetes Pod running a process, we can actually run any job in any language. It also isolates the compute and memory for all the jobs, and we can even customize how much compute and memory power we give to each job so if a job requires more power we can grant it that.\n* This is a screenshot of our actual Airflow installation and gives an example of the UI.\n\n![](../../../.gitbook/assets/airflow.png)\n\n### Kubernetes Secrets\n\n* To keep our connection strings and other configuration items confidential, we utilize [Kubernetes Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) and inject those as environment variables into our Kubernetes Pods. To inject a secret into the environment of a job run through an Airflow DAG, you must specify it in the [kube\\_secrets.py](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/dags/kube_secrets.py) then you can import it in the [DAG file](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/dags/extract/diagnostics.py#L8) and then finally inject it into the [Operator object](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/dags/extract/diagnostics.py#L49) itself.\n\n### Snowflake\n\n* [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) is a cloud- and SQL- based data warehouse platform that allows you to separate query compute power from data storage. It uses a proprietary data format for storing data and strives to provide a service that means you don\u2019t need a DBA to constantly monitor and tweak to keep the warehouse performant.\n\n#### Virtual warehouse\n\n* [Virtual warehouses](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/warehouses.html) are Snowflake\u2019s concept for a cluster of compute resources that can execute queries. You are billed based on how the size of the Virtual Warehouse and how long it is running for.\n\n**Stage and `COPY`**\n\n* [Stages](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/sql/create-stage.html) in Snowflake allow you to specify an external data source that you want to load data from. Once specified, you can run a simple `COPY INTO` command with a pattern, and in our case, will allow us to import data from S3 buckets. You can see how we utilize this [here](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/extract/s3_extract/stage_import.py).\n\n### dbt \\(data build tool\\)\n\n* [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction) is a tool, written in Python, that allows you to execute the `transform` step of your ELT or ETL process. \n* We use it to transform raw data in our Snowflake warehouse into more easily usable tables and views.\n* Our dbt implementation is [here](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/tree/master/transform/snowflake-dbt).\n* Dbt has a concept of [sources](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/using-sources) and [models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-models).\n  * An example sources file is [here](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/transform/snowflake-dbt/models/orgm/sources.yml) and this specifies already existing raw data that dbt can pull from to build models.\n  * Then, you can define models that reference the sources.\n  * Example:\n    * [https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/transform/snowflake-dbt/models/finance/\\*\\*account\\_daily\\_arr\\*\\*.sql](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/transform/snowflake-dbt/models/finance/**account_daily_arr**.sql).\n    * The filename \\(account\\_daily\\_arr\\) of the model file determines the object name in the database \\(in this case a table\\).\n\n### Meltano permissions\n\n* [Meltano](https://meltano.com/) is an overall framework that includes a lot more than what we\u2019re using it for.\n\n  We\u2019re actually just using a small piece that allows us to control our Snowflake user and role permissions in a fine-grained way.\n\n* The specific piece we use is [here](https://meltano.com/docs/command-line-interface.html#permissions).\n* We use this in the [snowflake\\_permissions DAG](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/dags/general/snowflake_permissions.py#L32). The interesting piece is the container\\_cmd lines. Essentially we create an entire Meltano project, but then just use a [roles.yml](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/load/snowflake/roles.yaml) file that we define to control the permissions.\n\n## Data sources\n\n### Telemetry\n\n* Telemetry data is data that's sent from Mattermost servers and makes its way to our data warehouse.\n  * This data is detailed [here](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/telemetry.html).\n* Currently, we use [Segment](https://segment.com/) to push this data to Snowflake.\n  * The data is available in its raw form in the Raw database, in the mattermost2 and mattermost\\_nps schemas.\n* We currently have a dbt model [here](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/transform/snowflake-dbt/models/mattermost/server_daily_details.sql) that uses this raw data, but will continue to add more.\n* Active User Counts\n  * Mattermost servers ping a Cloudfront endpoint with some basic telemetry. It uses the log format specified [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html#LogFileFormat).\n  * The import job uses code [here](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/extract/s3_extract/stage_import.py#L52).\n\n### Push notifications\n\n* Mattermost runs a proxy service that allows notifications to be sent through Apple and Google\u2019s respective notification services for mobile notifications. The log data is put into an S3 bucket and then ingested using Snowflake Stage and `COPY`. See [here](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/extract/s3_extract/stage_import.py#L58) for more details.\n\n### Server release\n\n* To help us track how many Mattermost servers are being deployed, there's a pingback which gets logged to an S3 bucket that we import. Details [here](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/extract/s3_extract/stage_import.py#L46).\n\n**License data**\n\n* Mattermost\u2019s enterprise license metadata is exported nightly to an S3 bucket and then we import it daily. Code [here](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/extract/s3_extract/stage_import.py#L42).\n\n### Stitch data\n\n* **Google Analytics**\n  * Overview\n    * Google Analytics - Stitch integration has a lot of caveats and limitations.\n    * Known limitations:\n      * Each set of dimensions and measures from Google Analytics needs to have its own Stitch integration.\n      * Each integration creates a schema in Snowflake that matches the name of the integration and adds a table called `report`.\n        * `Name: GA ChannelGrouping Source Users Org Schema: analytics.ga_channelgrouping_source_users_org Table: analytics.ga_channelgrouping_source_users_org.report`\n      * Once an integration is created, it can't be edited. If you need to make changes, you need to delete the integration and start over.\n      * Data is only pulled at a daily level.\n        * This is an issue because `Unique Monthly Users` is not the same as `Aggregated Unique Daily Users`.\n  * Mattermost.com\n    * [Google Analytics Link](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?authuser=0#/report-home/a120238482w177779216p176410444)\n    * Owner: Kevin Fayle\n    * Stitch integrations:\n      * [GA Mattermost Com Pages Visits](https://app.stitchdata.com/client/153136/pipeline/connections/226666/summary)\n        * Frequency: 6 hours\n        * Dimensions: **Page Path**, **Page Title**\n        * Measures: **Page Visits**, **Unique Page Visits**, **Avg Time on Page**\n  * Developers.Mattermost.com\n    * [Google Analytics Link](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/dashboard/uh0tcPOLS1ir9osCAZvBiQ/a64458817w179061281p177463446/)\n    * Owner: Kevin Fayle\n    * Stitch integrations:\n      * [GA Developers Pages Visits](https://app.stitchdata.com/client/153136/pipeline/connections/226635/summary)\n        * Frequency: 6 hours\n        * Dimensions: **Page Path**, **Page Title**\n        * Measures: **Page Visits**, **Unique Page Visits**, **Avg Time on Page**\n\n",

The main benefit of Kubernetes is being able to declaratively specify the resources you need and how much CPU and memory they require, and Kubernetes will figure out how to make it work. It will also attempt to restart VMs that have failed. We make use of <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/adovenmm/data-warehouse-psql/general\">Dockerfiles</a> for our images. We also use <a href=\"https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/airflow\">Bitnami\u2019s Airflow helm chart</a>.</li>\n<li>To keep our data and configuration confidential, we make use of <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/\">Kubernetes Secrets</a> which are only shared with team members who need access in LastPass.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Airflow</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>To access Airflow, you must be on VPN go to this <a href=\"http://airflow.internal.mattermost.com\">link</a>. The Airflow Creds are stored in the Shared-BizOps LastPass folder.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://airflow.apache.org/\">Apache Airflow</a> is a workflow orchestration tool built in Python that allows you to build and schedule <a href=\"https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/concepts.html#dags\">DAGs</a>. With these DAGs we can schedule jobs to run using <a href=\"https://crontab.guru/\">crontab style scheduling</a> and also declare dependencies between jobs so that we can ensure that data that we\u2019re processing doesn\u2019t get overwritten. Airflow also has great utilities for retrying failed jobs and alerting for job and DAG failures.</li>\n<li>We take advantage of <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/webhooks-incoming.html\">Mattermost incoming webhooks</a> to send DAG failures to a special internal Mattermost channel called BizOps where team members can triage the failure. We ensure that these get sent to Mattermost with our <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/dags/airflow_utils.py#L17\">failed task callback</a> which is specified in each <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/dags/extract/diagnostics.py#L24\">DAGs configuration</a>.</li>\n<li>We also utilize <a href=\"https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/airflow#option-3-get-your-dag-files-from-a-git-repository\">Bitnami\u2019s Get DAG files from a git repository</a> to automatically pull from the master branch of our <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse\">GitHub repository</a> every 60 seconds so our DAGs are always up to date.</li>\n<li>We use Airflow\u2019s new <a href=\"https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/kubernetes.html\">KubernetesPodOperator</a> that allows each of our jobs to run in its own Kubernetes Pod. The real flexibility with this is that because it\u2019s simply a Kubernetes Pod running a process, we can actually run any job in any language. It also isolates the compute and memory for all the jobs, and we can even customize how much compute and memory power we give to each job so if a job requires more power we can grant it that.</li>\n<li>This is a screenshot of our actual Airflow installation and gives an example of the UI.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/airflow.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Kubernetes Secrets</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>To keep our connection strings and other configuration items confidential, we utilize <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/\">Kubernetes Secrets</a> and inject those as environment variables into our Kubernetes Pods. To inject a secret into the environment of a job run through an Airflow DAG, you must specify it in the <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/dags/kube_secrets.py\">kube_secrets.py</a> then you can import it in the <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/dags/extract/diagnostics.py#L8\">DAG file</a> and then finally inject it into the <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/dags/extract/diagnostics.py#L49\">Operator object</a> itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Snowflake</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.snowflake.com/\">Snowflake</a> is a cloud- and SQL- based data warehouse platform that allows you to separate query compute power from data storage.

The business case will be shared with HR and Finance for approval. </p>\n<p>Step 3: HR and Finance will communicate the final approval decision to your Manager, Director, and Team MLT.</p>\n<p>If approved, then you\u2019re good to go! Start booking your tickets, travel, and accommodations and expense it via Airbase.</p>\n<p>Once approved, <strong>managers need to add the conference to the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ff3OdeMMDJlokoMwu3IX0v0D3B-_w8QZR5-4enhhIXs/edit#gid=0\">tracking spreadsheet</a></strong>.</p>",

        "content": "# Sustained Engineering\n\nThe Sustained Engineering Team \\(SET\\) is responsible for improving and maintaining quality of  Mattermost products, as well as helping support with any issues they require engineering support with. Often, people in SET primarily play the role of first responders, then handing off to whichever engineering team best equipped to resolve an issue.\n\n## Team members\n\nSET is a rotating team that is comprised of engineers from the different engineering teams. The rotation is on a two-week cycle. For engineers one of those weeks is as back-up, another is as primary.\n\nWho is currently on SET can be seen in the header of the [~Sustained Engineering](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/sustained-engineering) channel.\n\nEngineering teams will commit a total of 4 engineers (a primary and a backup for each of the two shifts) plus a lead to SET for each rotation. While on SET, an engineer still attends their team's meetings, but it should be taken into account that any SET-related issue may take them out of the regular day-to-day planned work. How this is managed is up to the engineering lead from the engineer's team, e.g.: some work on regular sprint work and accept the interruptions, others focus on fixing bugs to reduce the cost of context switching.\n\n## Roles\n\nThe **SET Lead** is one of the engineering team's Engineering Leads. The SET lead, leads the SET team during its rotation. In practice this means the SET Lead:\n\n1. Ensures that raised issues are being addressed.\n2. Communicates the status of ongoing issues appropriately to stakeholders.\n3. Is a point of escalation in case stakeholders do not know who else to escalate to.\n\nThe SET Lead is also on call (via OpsGenie), and is escalated to whenever neither the SET primary nor SET backup acknowledge an issue in the appropriate time.\n\nThe **SET Primary** is an engineer from one of the engineering teams. The SET Primary is the first person to respond to any issues escalated. Escalation primarily happens through the [~Sustained Engineering](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/sustained-engineering) channel or OpsGenie in cases of time urgency (refer to [Sources of escalations](#Sources-of-escalations) section for more details).\n\nThe **SET Backup** is an engineer from one of the engineering teams. In the case that the SET Primary is not available or unresponsive, the SET backup temporarily takes over. In certain situations it may also be required for the primary to ask for help to the backup.\n\n## Priority of work\n\nBelow is how SET prioritizes what is worked on.\n\n1. Quality issues affecting community.mattermost.com or community-daily.mattermost.com\n   * When a high impact issue affects the community server, SET responds and is responsible to coordinate fixing.\n   * The primary goal is to restore stability, whether this is achieved by fixing the issue or reverting code.\n2. Handles customer support escalation\n   * The primary goal is to help with issues that require code changes or in-depth knowledge of the code internals.\n   * Be helpful with training/knowledge sharing for the support team.\n   * Identify customer support requests that are features and route to PM as necessary.\n3. General bug fixes\n   * Pick up any bugs in triage.\n   * Work on bugs in this order: hotfix, release, customer reported, other.\n4. [~Ask R&D](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/ask-r-and-d) channel \u2014 this channel should be monitored, but checking it once or twice per day is sufficient.\n\n## Sources of escalations\n\nWork for SET comes from various sources:\n\n1. OpsGenie: Support has an e-mail address they will send urgent escalations to. These result in pages in OpsGenie, first sent to the SET Primary, then to SET Back-up and ultimately to the SET Lead when not timely acknowledged. **Note:** using this channel of escalation is exceedingly rare, and only happens in extremely time sensitive cases.\n2. The [~Sustained Engineering](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/sustained-engineering) channel. Support may use this channel to ask questions or raise urgent issues.\n3. The SET [Kanban Jira board](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=33). Tickets in the TO DO column should be organized from highest priority to lowest priority, based on the [Priority of Work](./#priority-of-work) section. The SET lead should make sure that the tickets are priority ordered but team members can move tickets around to meet the correct priorities as necessary. If tickets get stuck in a certain state, it's also the SET responsibility to push them to completion, either by nudging people or taking them over.\n4. The [~Ask R&D](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/ask-r-and-d) channel. This is the place where support and community can ask any type of R&D related questions.\n\n## SET weekly cycle\n\nWe use a Mattermost playbook to run the SET cycle. For this, the SET Lead creates a new run of the [SET Cycle](https://community.mattermost.com/playbooks/playbooks/w36ro78cgj8qtjq5mf6say7bxe/preview) playbook and follows the steps as codified by the playbook. Overall a SET cycles consists of three phases:\n\n1. Start: Review all ongoing issues and make sure they have appropriate owners in the current SET team.\n2. Monitor: Monitor the sources of SET escalations (previous section) and act accordingly (see next section).\n3. Hand-over: By Friday end of day, the SET leads ensures that the next week's SET team (especially the SET Lead) is aware of ongoing issues and have sufficient context to continue the work. Specifically:\n   * Ensure that the incoming SET team is in the right incident channels (if anybody).\n   * SET Jira tickets find new assignees in the incoming SET team.\n   * Any additional knowledge (beside what's in the Jira tickets and channels) that the incoming SET team will need to continue the work is transferred.\n\n## Workflow\n\nSupport may ask questions in the [~Sustained Engineering](https://community-daily.mattermost.com/core/channels/sustained-engineering) channel. If these can be answered without significant time investment (up to about an hour), just answer them. If they require deeper analysis, investigation, or potential hand-off to other people or teams, follow the following steps:\n\n1. **Create a Jira ticket** for the issue, initially connected to the \"Sustained Engineering\" team, and assigned to the SET Primary and moved to _In Progress_. Ensure the ticket describes the problem clearly and is as specific as possible. For example, if Mattermost is slow specify what is slow: the server, the client, a particular request.\n2. **Understand the customer impact and priority of the issue together with support.** Determine the priority of the issue following [the levels specified here](https://support.mattermost.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413076086548-Mattermost-Support-service-levels-and-their-severity), clearly mark this priority in the ticket. If the issue is really a feature request or low-urgency bug, change the ticket type and reassign it to the appropriate team. In that case, the SET responsibilities end. \n4. If the issue is of **L1 (critical) or L2 (major)** support [will have a run of the Mattermost Support Incident](https://community.mattermost.com/playbooks/playbooks/bx9xnkb8upribm3wsbye1cdwtw) playbook running that SET will be invited to. Make sure that updates (using the Playbooks \"Post update\" feature) are posted **at least daily**.\n3. **Investigate the source of the issue,** update the Jira ticket accordingly. Ensure the following things are clearly listed in the ticket (where appropriate):\n   * Mattermost version\n   * Database type and version\n   * Configuration used\n   * Relevant logs\n   * A CPU profile (in case of high-CPU usage issue)\n   * A heap profile (in case of memory use)\n   * Stack trace (in case  a service gets stuck)\n4. Hand-over (optional): once the issue is sufficiently narrowed down _and_ there is a more appropriate owner than SET, hand the issue over as follows:\n   * If a _Mattermost Support Incident_ playbook was run, invite the new owning team to the incident channel.\n   * Reassign the Jira ticket to the new owning team.\n\n**Important:** Even if an issue has been handed over, it remains SET responsibility to ensure good communication between engineering and other stakeholders.\n",

        "title": "Reliability Manifesto",
        "content": "# Reliability Manifesto\n\nThe Reliability Manifesto is a collection of rules, guidelines, and best practices that reflect our current thinking on what it takes to build a reliable and cost-effective system following a cloud first approach. This manifesto should keep things short, clear and easy to implement and monitor. This document should be acknowledged by all Mattermost teams that use the Mattermost cloud services and that develop code that will run in the production infrastructure.\n\nTo make things simple, we decided to split this document into a number of distinct categories that can be considered individual manifestos and can be seen below. \n\n- Foundation\n- Continuous Improvement \n- Design & Architecture \n- Observability \n- Performance & Cost Efficiency\n- Resilience\n- Security\n\n## Foundation\nThe set of rules that should set the foundation for this reliability manifesto.\n\n**F-1** We do not silently bypass the rules in this document, but instead, start a discussion to change the rules when we think something does not fit our situation.\n\n**F-2** This set of rules should reflect measurable targets in the quarter OKRs of the teams that utilize the Infrastructure platform. \n\n**F-3** We assess the validity of the rules in this document twice a year and we adapt accordingly.\n\n## Continuous Improvement\n\nThere is always room for improvement in our knowledge and our systems. The continuous improvement manifesto aims to make us more efficient, resilient and better engineers.\n\n**C-1** We should track all our production incidents. Major and critical incidents are reported and updated using our statuspage. All incidents are tracked via a Infrastructure Incident Response v2.0 playbook run. More details here.\n\n**C-2** Post mortem meetings and documents should follow every major and critical production incident. Runbooks if any should be added in the internal documentation for future reference.\n\n**C-3** No single engineer should fully deploy a new service across all environments. We share knowledge and reduce the team bus factor. \n\n**C-4** Blameless culture is a key. People make mistakes and systems do fail. We need to learn from them and help each other.\n\n## Design & Architecture\n\nBetter design and architectures create more reliable systems and reduce technical debt. This is what the Design & Architecture manifesto is all about. \n\n**D-1** Infrastructure team should be involved early in the design process for applications that will run in the infrastructure systems. Read about the [Production Readiness Review](/operations/research-and-development/engineering/infrastructure-engineering/production-readiness-review.md)\n\n**D-2** All new services should go through the POC phase and findings should be presented in a team meeting, together with proposal, design architecture and implementation steps. Example reference [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KZlemVB_75Xv4CDao5bcWpKml3fHbpcoAk_gWl8nFSY/edit).\n\n**D-3** We should avoid monolithic designs for custom services when possible. Microservice design should be the aim and services should be open sourced for community usage when they don\u2019t expose private company information.\n \n**D-4** All services should be followed by architecture diagrams (e.g. Lucidchart) when possible and documentation.\n\n**D-5** Always be mindful that services work in a different way at scale. Configurations that might work in local environments could have a major impact in production systems. For example, a possible abuse of the amount of database connections used. \n\n**D-6** All services should support the ability to turn off/on on demand without affecting the rest of the infrastructure services.\n\n## Observability\n\nThe observability manifesto should cover three main pillars:\n- Logs\n- Metrics\n- Tracing\n\n### Logs\n\n**O-1** Logs should include meaningful messages and stack trace should not be a requirement to understand the log message.\n\n**O-2** Service logs are enriched with metadata & attributes that differentiate the service (e.g service: ldap).\n\n**O-3** Logging levels should be consistent across services and false errors should be avoided to enable generation of metrics, patterns and dashboards.\n\n**O-4** Logging format structure should be consistent across services and should be agreed across all teams. String and JSON formats should be used for all logs. \n\n**O-5** Retention of 30 days for all critical and 7 days of all non-critical production system logs should be met. With exceptions, logs can be kept up to 1 year in S3 utilizing Glacier options.\n\n### Metrics\n**O-6** All services should export key metrics under /metrics path and should be enriched with metadata & attributes that differentiate the service (e.g service: playbooks).\n\n**O-7** All the application metrics should be exposed via 8067 port.\n\n**O-8** Application and service software version metrics of all applications should be exposed.\n\n**O-** The application and services should expose availability and latency metrics.\n\n**O-10** Raw metrics should be kept for 7 days and 5m/1h resolution metrics should be kept for 365 days for all production systems. \n\n## Performance & Cost Efficiency\n\nImproving performance and cutting costs of our systems makes our services more competitive and efficient. This is what the Performance & Cost Efficiency manifesto is all about. \n\n**P-1** We avoid the solution of throwing money to the problem. If a system constantly needs money to perform, we need to seek for other solutions.\n\n**P-2** We utilize cost optimization at scale. The more customers we add, the better we should utilize our shared infrastructure and cost per customer KPI should be reduced. \n\n**P-3** We should aim for a 2% increase in our spot machines in each quarter with a maximum of 50% of the total fleet.\n\n**P-4** The cost of non production environments should not exceed 30% of the total Mattermost infrastructure environments cost.  \n\n## Resilience\n\nResilience ensures that our services are there for our customers even on bad days. This is what this manifesto is about.\n\n**R-1** We should always aim for higher SLOs than the ones promised to our customers. The SRE team would influence other teams on what needs to be improved to meet higher SLAs. \n\n**R-2** Each service should have a dedicated SLO target, which should always be higher than the external SLO.\n\n**R-3** We run monthly gamedays, injecting chaos to the system. The impact should be measured and post game day actions should be defined. The whole team should be involved.\n\n**R-4** Disaster recovery protocols and playbooks should be defined for all our key components (K8s Clusters, Database Clusters, DNS, etc.)\n\n## Security\n\nKeeping our systems secure, keeps our customers safe and our nights lighter. This is what the Security manifesto is all about. \n\n**S-1** We follow security team guidelines and we get security team approval on new system deployments.\n\n**S-2** We reduce our attack surface by not exposing to the public internet whatever should not be public. \n\n**S-3** Secrets should be stored in secret management services (eg. Vault, AWS Secret Manager) and not in Gitlab/Github repos. \n\n**S-4** Security groups should be applied in all machines and limit access only to ports and sources needed. Both deployment and evaluation should be done in an automated way.\n\n**S-5** IAM Roles should be used when possible, IAM users should be avoided and IAM policies should be granting least privilege.\n\n**S-6** We should always aim to eliminate high severity issues arising from security tooling analysis (e.g Stackrox).\n",

If you wish you can state your full legal name as part of your partner description.\n* **Partner Description:** Between 30-100 words describing your business. See examples at [https://mattermost.com/partners/](https://mattermost.com/partners/).\n* **City, State/Province, and Country:** Location of key office or offices providing Mattermost services, or global headquarters.\n* **Website:** URL of main website for your organization.\n* **Logo:** At least 200px wide.\n\nIf you have joined the Value-Added Reseller program, your reseller territory will appear in the listing as well.\n\n### Listing location of key office\n\nIn the partner listing, city locations follow a \"concise clarity\" principle:\n\n* Cities that are not well-known, or which have very similiarly-named cities in the same country, are displayed as CITY, STATE/PROVINCE, COUNTRY.\n* Well-known and uniquely-named cities, display as CITY, COUNTRY.\n\nFor example: A well-known city with a unique name like Johannesburg would be displayed as \"Johannesburg, South Africa\" and not \"Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa\", which is unnecessarily long. Similiarly a less well-known city, like \"Arvada\" is referenced as \"Arvada, Colorado, USA\".\n\n## Partner Evaluation License\n\nAs a Value-Added Reseller or Deployment Solution Partner, you can request a renewable 1-year E20 license for up to 50 users.\n\n* Go to [https://www.mattermost.com/trial/](https://www.mattermost.com/trial/) to complete a trial form and enter \\[RESELLER\\] after your organization name.\n* In the \u201cWhere are you with Mattermost\u201d section, select **Other**.\n* Please send an email to partners@mattermost.com letting us know the above have been completed so your application can be reviewed and matched against our certified reseller database.\n* Please expect delivery in 2-3 business days.\n\n## Mattermost Partner Program FAQ\n\nFrequently asked questions from Mattermost partners.\n\n### Can a partner sell Mattermost products without revealing the name of an end customer?\n\nNo. Mattermost, Inc. must know all end customers with whom it does business. This is important for Mattermost to be able to service and renew the end customer if the reseller relationship is discontinued. Moreover, Mattermost cannot do business with customers in countries embargoed by the United States, and this must be confirmed in any commercial transaction.\n",

See examples at <a href=\"https://mattermost.com/partners/\">https://mattermost.com/partners/</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>City, State/Province, and Country:</strong> Location of key office or offices providing Mattermost services, or global headquarters.</li>\n<li><strong>Website:</strong> URL of main website for your organization.</li>\n<li><strong>Logo:</strong> At least 200px wide.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have joined the Value-Added Reseller program, your reseller territory will appear in the listing as well.</p>\n<h3>Listing location of key office</h3>\n<p>In the partner listing, city locations follow a \"concise clarity\" principle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cities that are not well-known, or which have very similiarly-named cities in the same country, are displayed as CITY, STATE/PROVINCE, COUNTRY.</li>\n<li>Well-known and uniquely-named cities, display as CITY, COUNTRY.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example: A well-known city with a unique name like Johannesburg would be displayed as \"Johannesburg, South Africa\" and not \"Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa\", which is unnecessarily long. Similiarly a less well-known city, like \"Arvada\" is referenced as \"Arvada, Colorado, USA\".</p>\n<h2>Partner Evaluation License</h2>\n<p>As a Value-Added Reseller or Deployment Solution Partner, you can request a renewable 1-year E20 license for up to 50 users.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to <a href=\"https://www.mattermost.com/trial/\">https://www.mattermost.com/trial/</a> to complete a trial form and enter [RESELLER] after your organization name.</li>\n<li>In the \u201cWhere are you with Mattermost\u201d section, select <strong>Other</strong>.</li>\n<li>Please send an email to partners@mattermost.com letting us know the above have been completed so your application can be reviewed and matched against our certified reseller database.</li>\n<li>Please expect delivery in 2-3 business days.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Mattermost Partner Program FAQ</h2>\n<p>Frequently asked questions from Mattermost partners.</p>\n<h3>Can a partner sell Mattermost products without revealing the name of an end customer?</h3>\n<p>No. Mattermost, Inc. must know all end customers with whom it does business. This is important for Mattermost to be able to service and renew the end customer if the reseller relationship is discontinued. Moreover, Mattermost cannot do business with customers in countries embargoed by the United States, and this must be confirmed in any commercial transaction.</p>",

        "content": "# Working on Security-sensitive Pull Requests\n\n## Overview\n\nThis document aims to lay down some guidelines on how to work with security-sensitive changes in public Git repositories.\n\n## Goals\n\nEstablish and document a way of working that:\n\n 1. Minimizes the risk of vulnerability information leaking out before a fix is made available.\n 2. Minimizes the friction caused for developers, QA, and security engineers actively working on a security issue.\n 3. Is easy to understand and adopt, given the existing PR process.\n 4. Is easy to remember and follow.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe guidelines documented here only apply to open source products maintained by Mattermost. Closed-source work does not have the same considerations and does not need to follow the guidelines laid out here.\n\n## Background reading\n\nSimilar documentation by Mozilla used as the inspiration for this document: https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/processes/fixing-security-bugs.html\n\n## Guidelines by engineering area\n\nThe guidelines below are split by work area; start by reading the [Common Guidelines](#common-guidelines) section, then proceed to whichever follow-up section is relevant to you.\n\n### Common guidelines\n\nWhen working on security-sensitive changes, pay attention to what is public and what is not. Be mindful about entering information into systems such as Mattermost Channels and Boards, GitHub Issues and Pull Requests, and Jira.\n\nWhen discussing related work in public channels, such as a CI pipeline failure blocking the security release or feature work that had to be postponed because of the incident, pay attention to the ways you reference the private information. Avoid sharing ticket IDs or mentioning key words like \"security\": every time you reference the issue in an identifiable way, you add contextual information, and that information can eventually add up to something that's useful to an attacker.\nSpecific words and phrases to be extra careful with:\n\n - Obvious key words: \"security\", \"vulnerability\", \"exploit\", \"insecure\", \"attack\".\n - Anything that identifies a vulnerability type: \"XSS\", \"authentication bypass\", \"authorization bug\", \"SQL injection\", \"remote code execution\", etc.\n - Security-specific tools and terminology: \"HackerOne\", \"CVE\", \"CVSS\", \"advisory\", \"pentest\".\n\n### Guidelines for developers\n\nWhen developing a fix for a security issue, bear in mind that the code, comments, unit tests, and commit messages become public information as soon as they are pushed to the remote repository. Apply [Common Guidelines](#common-guidelines) accordingly.\n\n**When commenting on your code**, keep references to security issues to a minimum. For example: If it's necessary to highlight that a non-obvious validation check is necessary for security, avoid the following:\n\n{% hint style=\"danger\" %}\n```go\n// Do not remove! This check prevents a security issue!\nif url.Opaque != \"\" {\n    return \"\", errors.New(\"malformed URL\");\n}\n```\n{% endhint %}\n\nInstead refer to the ticket ID or some other opaque identifier only:\n\n{% hint style=\"success\" %}\n```go\n// See MM-1234\nif url.Opaque != \"\" {\n    return \"\", errors.New(\"malformed URL\");\n}\n```\n{% endhint %}\n\nWith the latter, any other staff member or your future self can still easily find the context, but you avoid pointing out to would-be attackers that the change is critical for security.\n\n**When developing unit/e2e tests**, do not use the Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits received from the security team or documented on the vulnerability ticket as-is: the purpose of these PoCs is to clearly demonstrate the security issue and its implications, which often means they are very easy to \"weaponize\". Instead, test the intended functionality using more benign payloads. For example in the case of a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue resulting from missing HTML special character escaping, test the fix using sets of individual characters or garbage input instead of a full XSS payload. If you are unsure about your approach to testing, ask the Security team!\n\n**When submitting PRs**, pay attention to the PR title and description. Remember the Common Guidelines and do not use the title of the Jira ticket as-is. The title of the PR is one of the most visible and obvious indicators of a security issue being worked on! It appears on the PR itself, the pull requests index page\u2014both of which attackers are likely to monitor\u2014and eventually ends up in Git history when the PR is squashed and merged. The guidelines also apply to individual commit messages and the name of the branch!\n\n- If you notice you've made a mistake in the code, unit tests, comments, or commit messages and already pushed it to GitHub, fix it as soon as possible by rewriting the Git history and force-pushing the new, sanitized changes.\n- If you notice you've made a mistake in the PR title or description, edit it out and alert the Security team: Edits will still be visible in the GitHub UI and if the information revealed is sensitive enough, Security may choose to fully delete the PR in question.\n\n### Guidelines for QA\n\nWhen QA testing a security fix, keep in mind that any test steps documented on the Jira ticket are most likely sensitive and should not be publicly disclosed. When a test step fails or the instructions are unclear, feel free to request changes on the Pull Request if applicable, but try to keep the details private: use Jira or Mattermost Channels.\n\nIf unsure about how to thoroughly QA test a security fix or how to set up the environment required, feel free to leave QA testing to the security team. For automated testing, also see the [Guidelines for Developers](#guidelines-for-developers) section.\n\n### Guidelines for security engineering\n\nAs security engineers coordinate an incident with both engineering staff and external contributors, the same Common Guidelines apply. The security engineer currently responsible for coordinating an incident is also in the end responsible for making sure other engineering staff is aware of the guidelines and follows them to the best of their ability.\n\nSecurity engineers should monitor any public activity around an incident, such as information unintentionally leaking, outside parties commenting on Pull Requests, or the reporter of the issue actively leaking information on social media.\n\nThe responsibility of maintaining this document also rests with security engineering: If a specific guideline cannot be reasonably applied in a large number of cases, the guideline should be updated. Similarly, if information appears to be consistently leaking despite following these guidelines, improvements should be planned and documented.\n",

        "content": "# Product Vulnerability Process\n\n## Overview\nThis document aims to provide guidance on the handling of product vulnerabilities.\nIt describes the process and provides background information and definitions for the daily usage of all relevant stakeholders.\n\n## Goals\nEstablish and document a way of working that ensures:\n\n* Vulnerabilities are triaged efficiently and quickly\n* All parties are aligned around ownership and expectations\n* Patch releases are available within the agreed SLAs\n* Minimize the risk for Mattermost Cloud, on-premises customers, and Mattermost, Inc.\n\n## Scope\nThis process covers any vulnerabilities found in officially published Mattermost products or services that were either found internally, reported to us by a customer, or come in through the bug bounty program or via another third party.\n\nInfrastructure vulnerabilities are explicitly out of scope for this process. Vulnerability management, as it relates to infrastructure, is owned by the Security Operations Team.\n\n## Process Definitions\n\n### Responsible Parties\n- **Product Security Team:** Process Ownership; Vulnerability Owner\n- **Development Team:** Vulnerability Remediation\n- **Release Manager:** Release Planning\n- **Release Team:** Build Process\n- **Marketing Team:** Security Updates Email Newsletter Distribution\n- **Security Operations:** Vulnerability mitigation for Mattermost Cloud, verification whether it\u2019s been exploited in Mattermost Cloud.\n\n### Vulnerability Sources\nVulnerabilities are reported from a variety of sources that are explained below.\n\n#### Internal Finding\nThe vulnerability has been discovered by the internal security, development, or QA team.\n\n#### Security Automation\nThe vulnerability has been discovered by internal security automation tools such as Dependency Track or CodeQL\n\n#### Responsible Disclosure\nThe vulnerability has been reported through our [responsible disclosure program](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/).\n\n#### Bug Bounty Program\nThe vulnerability has been reported through our [Bug Bounty program running on HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/mattermost?type=team).\n\n#### Customer Report\nThe vulnerability has been reported from customers as part of an internal audit or on-going operations.\n\n#### Public Leak\nThe vulnerability has not been officially reported, but released to the public without any notice. It is possible that it can contain reproduction steps or not.\n\n### Vulnerability Severity\nVulnerabilities must be scored according to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 3.1 (CVSS 3.1). The CVSS is an industry-wide accepted standard to determine the impact of vulnerabilities in software products and takes impacts such as attack vector, complexity, user interaction, scope, and various other components into consideration. The Product Security Engineer may overwrite the CVSS severity if we think the risk to our customers is lower or higher than the calculated score. A justification must be provided in the vulnerability ticket.\n\nFIRST provides a CVSS calculator at the following URL: https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1\n\nThe CVSS 3.1 provides a textural representation of the severity score in Section 5 of the Specification Document. The mapping is included below:\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th style=\"text-align:left\">Rating</th>\n      <th style=\"text-align:left\">CVSS Score</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>None</td>\n            <td>0.0</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Low</td>\n            <td>0.1 - 3.9</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Medium</td>\n            <td>4.0 - 6.9</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>High</td>\n            <td>7.0 - 8.9</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Critical</td>\n            <td>9.0 - 10.0</td>\n        </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n### Remediation SLAs\nRefer to this [internal matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10XHFqy8NdbdpVNtxqz9GQL6oTlhf3jx5I3IDv9Oh-c8/edit#gid=0).\n\n### Issue Types\nVulnerabilities must be assigned one of the following vulnerability types:\n\n* [CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]( https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)\n* [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)\n* [CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html)\n* [CWE-287: Improper Authentication](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)\n* [CWE-284: Improper Access Control](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)\n* [CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)\n* [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)\n* [CWE-1395: Dependency on Vulnerable Third-Party Component](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1395.html)\n* [CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/74.html)\n* [CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/922.html)\n* [CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)\n* [CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html)\n* [CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html)\n\n### Backport Policy\nFor Mattermost server, the following backport policy applies:\n\n#### Vulnerabilities with Low Score:\n- Upcoming Release\n- Extended Support Release\n\n#### Vulnerabilities with Medium to Critical Score:\n- Upcoming Release\n- Extended Support Release\n- Last 3 Releases\n\n**Notes**:\n* The Mattermost server policy also applies to vulnerabilities in bundled plugins within the respective version\n* There is no backport policy for Desktop, Mobile and standalone plugins.\n* Bundled plugins are the plugins that are pre-installed in the Mattermost server. The list of bundled plugins can be found in Mattermost server's [Makefile](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/blob/master/server/Makefile#L141). Any other plugin is considered standalone.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Report\nVulnerability reports are received from internal or external parties via one of the methods outlined above. The Product Security Team must acknowledge to the reporter that it received the report within 48 hours on business days and will investigate whether it\u2019s a valid issue.\n\nAfter the report was received, a \u201cSecurity Vulnerability\u201d ticket must be created in the Jira ticket that contains the following information:\n\n* Title\n* Description\n* Category [If possible]\n* Reporter\n* Source\n* Component\n\nThe security engineer that acknowledges the initial report must create a Mattermost Playbook Run using the \"Security Vulnerability Playbook\" and follow the process steps documented to continue with the Triage step. The playbook links to the Jira ticket created above, ensures the right process steps are completed, and informs relevant parties.\n\nIf the vulnerability was published on a news site/blog/etc. and is considered a public leak the Head of Marketing and VP Legal should be notified and invited to the playbook run.\n\n### Triage\nAfter a vulnerability report was acknowledged it must be confirmed whether it is a valid finding within 96 hours of receiving it on business days. The security engineer should determine:\n\n* Is the report a duplicate of a previous or current report from another reporter?\n* Does the report have a security impact?\n* Can the report be reproduced?\n\n* If neither of the above hold true, does the report have an impact on any production infrastructure or systems and thus should be reviewed nevertheless?\n\nAfter confirming that the report is valid the Product Security Team member must move the report to the next stage, called \u201cRemediation\u201d and must fill in the following information in the ticket:\n\n* Vulnerability Category\n* Steps to Reproduce\n* Recommended Mitigation\n* Security Update Text\n* CVSS Score\n* CVSS Severity\n* Final Severity\n* Mattermost Team\n* Development Team\n* Playbook Run link\n* HackerOne Link\n* Affected On-Premises Versions [Text]\n* Affects Cloud [Yes/No]\n\n**Additional auto-populated fields**\n* A Mattermost-specific vulnerability ID is automatically assigned when a report is moved from \u201cTriage\u201d to \u201cFix Development\u201d.\n* A Due Date field is automatically populated when when a report is moved from \u201cTriage\u201d to \u201cFix Development\u201d based on the Final Severity and the SLAs.\n\nIf the vulnerability is not confirmed valid or considered a duplicate, the security engineer must notify the reporter about the decision. If we don\u2019t consider it a vulnerability, the justification for our decision should be included both in the response to the reporter and as a comment in the Product Vulnerability ticket. The ticket should afterwards be closed either as duplicate or as invalid.\n\nIf the report is deemed a security improvement (but not vulnerability), a development ticket should be created and the security vulnerability ticket closed with the development ticket added as a reference. A report is considered a security improvement when it is not exploitable without the presence of any additional vulnerabilities or only increases the general security posture.\n\n### Remediation\nThe Product Security Engineer must create a development ticket and link it to the vulnerability ticket. The Lead Engineer and the Product Manager of the feature team responsible for the vulnerability fix and the Release Manager should be invited in the vulnerability\u2019s playbook run channel and be informed about the vulnerability and its severity. The Lead Engineer must acknowledge the report and assign the development ticket to an engineer. The Lead Engineer should work together with the Product Manager on the prioritization of the reported security vulnerability.\n\nThe development team is responsible for the development of the fix. The assigned Product Security Engineer is responsible to notify the developer teams if an agreed SLAs is at risk for the fix development and document once the SLA is broken. Developers should work together with the assigned Product Security Engineer during the vulnerability remediation to clarify questions and mitigation approaches.  Once the development team finishes the development of the fix for the current version, the assigned Product Security Engineer should review that the fix properly mitigates the vulnerability. The fix must then be backported to previous releases. This is not the case if:\n\n* The affected feature did not exist in the version in question\n* The vulnerability has a low severity\n\nIf in doubt, refer to the Backport Policy section above. After the fix development has finished and has been reviewed by peers, security and QA, a new dot release must be prepared.\n\nIn parallel with the development of the fix by the Engineering team, the Product Security Engineer must invite in the playbook run channel the Security Operations team, if the vulnerability is of \u201cHigh\u201d or \u201cCritical\u201d severity or if cloud installations are at risk of exploitation.\nIf cloud installations are at risk of exploitation, the Security Operations team must look at possible no-code mitigation steps to prevent the vulnerability from being exploited in the cloud until a fix is deployed.\nIf the vulnerability is of \u201cHigh\u201d or \u201cCritical\u201d severity, the Security Operations team must investigate for any exploitation attempts with the guidance of Product Security. If exploitation is confirmed, a separate process will be triggered which is outside of the scope of this document. The Product Security Engineer may invite the Security Operations team to look for exploitation attempts for \u201cMedium\u201d severity vulnerabilities on a case by case manner.\n\n### Release Preparation\nAfter reviews have been completed, the developer must notify the Cloud SRE team and the Release Manager that a new cloud release version can be cut. Cloud rings soak times for patches with vulnerability fixes can be found in this [internal matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14PKKSezXtzOLWis1xZVfYnSfM0Dz7pK4lOQ-zMYvC-E/edit?usp=sharing). Once the cloud release patch with the fix has been rolled out in the cloud, the Release Manager must cut a new dot release for all versions that received the security fix and release it. In case there are any problems during the release, the Delivery team should be notified to fix potential issues.\n\nAfter the new versions are released, the Release Manager must update the [hall of fame list](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report) based on the Reporter field from the Jira ticket.\n\n### Post Mortem\nThe Product Security Engineer must conduct a post mortem using the provided template for any vulnerabilities with \u201cHigh\u201d or \u201cCritical\u201d severity. The Product Security Engineer and the Lead Engineer of the feature team responsible for the vulnerability fix should meet and discuss:\n\n* Why did this vulnerability occur?\n* How can we verify that the vulnerability doesn\u2019t exist in other parts of the product?\n* What actions do we need to take to prevent it from happening again?\n\nThe outcome of the post mortem must be action items based on the answers to the questions above. The Product Security Engineer must then fill the retrospective of the playbook run based on the answers in the above questions and create backlog tickets with the agreed action items.\n\nThe Release Manager must create a draft for the email newsletter. The Marketing team and Product Security Engineering Lead must review the draft and send it out to all subscribers of the Security Updates mailing list.\n\n### Responsible Disclosure\nThis section is applicable if the vulnerability affects publicly released software artifacts.\n\nOnce the versions with the vulnerability fix are released, the Product Security Engineer must verify that all required information is included in the initial vulnerability ticket.  The Release Manager must publish the security update notes for the vulnerabilities that have been fixed and released in the [Mattermost Security Updates](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) page.\nNo details must be added in the \u201cIssue Details\u201d. Instead the following message must be posted: *\u201cDetails on the security update will be posted here on DATE, as per our Responsible Disclosure Policy.\u201d* The DATE refers to 30 days after the release day.\n\nThe Product Security Engineer must prepare for a CVE disclosure. Specifically the Product Security Engineer must create a JSON file with all the needed CVE information. A tool like [vulnogram](https://vulnogram.github.io/#editor) can be used for this purpose. A CVE ID can be reserved using the [cvelib](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/cvelib) library.\n\n30 days after the release with the vulnerability fix, the Product Security Engineer must publish the CVE details using the [cvelib](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/cvelib) library. At the same time, the release manager must update the security update notes for vulnerabilities released in the [Mattermost Security Updates](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) page, this time properly populating the content of the \u201cIssue Details\u201d column.\n\n## Responsibilities Matrix\n|    | Product Security | Development Team | Release Manager | Security Operations | Marketing | SRE |\n|---|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|\n|Triage Vulnerability | x  |   |   |   |  |  |\n|Product Vulnerability & Development fix Jira tickets creation| x |   |   |   | | |\n|Product Vulnerability Jira status progression & fields completion| x |   |   |   |  | |\n|Security Vulnerability Playbook run creation & administration | x |   |   |   |  | |\n|Vulnerability fix development|   | x  |   |   |  |  |\n|Discovery of exploitation attempts (High/Critical only)|   |   |   | x | |  |\n|Security Review of the fix| x  |   |   |   |  |  |\n|Notify the Release Manager for a new release version cut|   | x  |   |   | |  |\n|Cloud Release Preparation|   |   | x |   | | x |  |\n|Self Hosted Release Preparation|   |   | x |   | |   |\n|Post Mortem discussion (High/Critical only) | x  | x  |  |   | |   |\n|Post Mortem documentation & action items Jira tickets creation (High/Critical only) | x  |  |  |   | |   |\n|Email newsletter draft|   |  | x |   |  | |  |\n|Update the [hall of fame list](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report)|   |  | x |   |  | |  |\n|Review newsletter draft & send it to the Security Updates mailing list|     |  |  |   | x  |  |  |\n|Release of the security update notes|   |  | x |   |  |   |\n|Prepare and publish CVE| x  |  |  |   |  |   |\n",

Instead the following message must be posted: <em>\u201cDetails on the security update will be posted here on DATE, as per our Responsible Disclosure Policy.\u201d</em> The DATE refers to 30 days after the release day.</p>\n<p>The Product Security Engineer must prepare for a CVE disclosure. Specifically the Product Security Engineer must create a JSON file with all the needed CVE information. A tool like <a href=\"https://vulnogram.github.io/#editor\">vulnogram</a> can be used for this purpose. A CVE ID can be reserved using the <a href=\"https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/cvelib\">cvelib</a> library.</p>\n<p>30 days after the release with the vulnerability fix, the Product Security Engineer must publish the CVE details using the <a href=\"https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/cvelib\">cvelib</a> library. At the same time, the release manager must update the security update notes for vulnerabilities released in the <a href=\"https://mattermost.com/security-updates/\">Mattermost Security Updates</a> page, this time properly populating the content of the \u201cIssue Details\u201d column.</p>\n<h2>Responsibilities Matrix</h2>\n<p>|    | Product Security | Development Team | Release Manager | Security Operations | Marketing | SRE |\n|---|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|\n|Triage Vulnerability | x  |   |   |   |  |  |\n|Product Vulnerability &amp; Development fix Jira tickets creation| x |   |   |   | | |\n|Product Vulnerability Jira status progression &amp; fields completion| x |   |   |   |  | |\n|Security Vulnerability Playbook run creation &amp; administration | x |   |   |   |  | |\n|Vulnerability fix development|   | x  |   |   |  |  |\n|Discovery of exploitation attempts (High/Critical only)|   |   |   | x | |  |\n|Security Review of the fix| x  |   |   |   |  |  |\n|Notify the Release Manager for a new release version cut|   | x  |   |   | |  |\n|Cloud Release Preparation|   |   | x |   | | x |  |\n|Self Hosted Release Preparation|   |   | x |   | |   |\n|Post Mortem discussion (High/Critical only) | x  | x  |  |   | |   |\n|Post Mortem documentation &amp; action items Jira tickets creation (High/Critical only) | x  |  |  |   | |   |\n|Email newsletter draft|   |  | x |   |  | |  |\n|Update the <a href=\"https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report\">hall of fame list</a>|   |  | x |   |  | |  |\n|Review newsletter draft &amp; send it to the Security Updates mailing list|     |  |  |   | x  |  |  |\n|Release of the security update notes|   |  | x |   |  |   |\n|Prepare and publish CVE| x  |  |  |   |  |   |</p>",

Abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/mattercon/mattermost-code-of-conduct).\n\n## Mattermost Communication Guidelines\n\n## Meeting Etiquette\n\nInspired by Corey Hulen's blog article of [6 Annoying Things People Do During Video Conferencing](http://hulen.com/video-conf-peevs/).\n\n1. Avoid responding to messages in chat while on a meeting.\n * It can be distracting when someone tries to covertly respond to a message. First, other people on the call may hear your keyboard and notice you\u2019re looking somewhere else. Second, if they are in the same channel as you, they can see the message **[User] is typing...** in Mattermost.\n * **Tip:** If you feel the need to respond immediately and are easily distracted, set yourself to \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d mode while in meetings.\n2. Avoid answering calls or checking text messages on your cell phone.\n * **Tip:** Put your phone on silent and place it out of arm\u2019s reach, face down, so you don\u2019t feel compelled to act.\n3. Display your video on a monitor with your camera.\n * If you have your video display on a second monitor, it may cause you to look away from the camera, not looking at the camera when talking. It almost feels like you\u2019re talking to someone else in the room behind your computer monitor.\n * **Tip:** Either move your camera, or move your video window so they are somewhat inline. Also remember to look towards the camera.\n4. Mute audio in large video conferences when not speaking.\n  * When not muted, others can hear random noises, like a fan running or a loud click-clack keyboard, which can be distracting.\n  * **Tip:** Set your Zoom meetings to be on mute by default via Zoom settings.\n5. Avoid fidgeting uncontrollably or spinning in your office chair.\n  * **Tip:** If you\u2019re in a group meeting and not doing much talking, feel free to stop your video.\n6. Avoid connecting with your computer but also dialing in via cell phone.\n  * If you connect with your computer and dial in, there are two of you in the meeting and the voice/video aren't synced when you talk. In large groups, there will be a random cell phone number that no one will know who they are.\n  * **Tip:** If you have a bad internet connection and have to dial in, exit the Zoom meeting on your computer.\n7. When presenting, increase window zoom size or set Powerpoint slides to presenter mode.\n  * Otherwise, the text on screen may be too hard for others to see.\n\n## Meeting Elements\n\nHere we summarize meeting elements that can be re-used for meetings across teams.\n\n### Ice-breaker\n\n* 2 - 3 minute exercises designed to learn more about colleagues at the start of a recurring meeting.\n* Typically rotates in random order with names pulled. As an example, the [R&D Meeting Ice-breaker List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dCgKFdYkaDYd7yzgbK2VcqscZ1Ni5uNnnkZZv63XtOg/edit#gid=0) rotates three colleagues per meeting (2 R&D staff, 1 \u2018other\u2019 (e.g. Sales, Ops, etc).\n\nExamples:\n * \u201cHobby talk\u201d - Sharing about an interesting hobby, past or present.\n * \u201cMy home town\u201d - Sharing something interesting about where you grew up.\n * \u201cTwo truths and a lie\u201d - Share two true facts about yourself and one lie, team guesses which is the lie.\n * \u201cQuestions\u201d - e.g. \u201cWhat would constitute a \u201cperfect\u201d day for you?\u201d\n * Need further inspiration? Take a look [here](https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/the-25-most-popular-icebreaker-questions-based-on-four-years-of-data-893df9b27531).\n\n### Blindspots, Inspiration, Knowledge Share\n\n* Exercise to find blindspots in team thinking at the end of a meeting.\n* Items for team discussion can also be queued in this section.\n* Colleagues share areas of concern and ask questions which invariably disclose blindspots or are an opportunity to improve communication.\n\nExamples of questions:\n * \u201cWhat\u2019s the status on X?\u201d // Often an important item that got forgotten.\n * \u201cWho owns X?\u201d // Reveals need for more clarity or communication.\n * \u201cWhy do we do X?\u201d // Lets us verify if a process is needed, and if we\u2019re handling it the right way.\n",

        "content": "---\ndescription: Description of norms on Mattermost Community server\n---\n\n# Workplace\n\n## What is the Mattermost community server?\n\nThe Mattermost community server runs the latest stable build of Mattermost's software, including all open source code for Mattermost Team Edition as well as commercial code for Mattermost Enterprise Edition.\n\nIt has two objectives:\n\n* Provide a workplace for Mattermost staff.\n* Engage with our [communities](../../contributors/contributors/community.md), including users, contributors and partners.\n\n**The Mattermost community server is not a production server and has occasional downtime.**\n\nYou can reach the server at:\n\n{% embed url=\"https://community.mattermost.com\" caption=\"\" %}\n\nThe server is also available via the following URLs, primarily used to test pre-release features:\n\n* [https://community-release.mattermost.com](https://community-release.mattermost.com), which runs our upcoming stable release. This server includes work-in-progress features, and can contain bugs and have occasional downtime. This server receives regular pushes of features and/or bug fixes of the next release for testing purposes.\n* [https://community-daily.mattermost.com](https://community-daily.mattermost.com), which runs latest builds of Mattermost's software, including all pre-release features of our core products. It is the most unstable version of the Mattermost community server. Bugs and occasional downtime is expected as this server receives daily pushes of features and/or bug fixes for testing purposes.\n\nThe server has two teams:\n\n### Contributors team\n\nURL: [https://community.mattermost.com/core](https://community.mattermost.com/core/messages/@github)\n\nAvailable to anyone who'd like to join the server using either an email and password account \\([you can sign-up for a free account online](https://community.mattermost.com/signup_user_complete)\\) or a Mattermost staff account, which is set up via Okta and requires MFA either through Okta or Google Authenticator.\n\n### Staff team\n\nURL: [https://community.mattermost.com/private-core](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/fy21-devops-awareness)\n\nA confidential space for [Mattermost staff](../../contributors/contributors/community.md#mattermost-staff) requiring a Mattermost Okta account and MFA.\n\n#### Staff usernames on the Mattermost server\n\nAll Mattermost staff members hired after Jan 1, 2020 should have a username in the form of `@[FIRST_NAME]_[LAST_NAME]` for example \"Alice Evans\" should be `alice.evans`.\n\nIf there are duplicate first name and last names, the new person added should add a middle initial in the form of `@[FIRST_NAME].[MIDDLE_INITIAL].[LAST_NAME]` for example, \"Alice Janice Evans\" who joined after the first Alice Evans would be `@alice.j.evans`.\n\nThere are some user accounts that for legacy issues cannot use this format, for all other Mattermost staff--even those who joined before Jan 1 2020--should use the format that creates the most clarity.\n\n#### Not mentioning staff while referring to them\n\nBy default, people's user names and first names trigger mention notifications in Mattermost. This can be distracting if people have the same first names, for example there are multiple people named \"Chris\" at Mattermost. If you want to mention someone without triggering a notification consider using their three letter initials, for example, \"Alice Emily Evans\" would be `AEE`.\n\nAs an alternative to saying `@alice.evans` using `AEE` lets you refer to the person in passing without pushing an alert to them. For staff members that want to be alerted to even passing mentions of their name, they can opt in to that model by creating a [keyword notification](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/messaging/mentioning-teammates.html#words-that-trigger-mentions) on their three letter initials.\n\n## Key channels for staff\n\nThe following table lists popular channels for Staff:\n\n| Purpose | Name | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| ANNOUNCE  Asynchronous Announcements | [Announcements](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/announcements) | **Public channel in STAFF team** for making staff-wide announcements. |\n| ANNOUNCE  Synchronous Announcements | [Customer Obsession Meeting](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-cadence#customer-obsession-meeting-aka-com) | **Public channel in STAFF team** for weekly all-staff meeting \\(see link in header for more info on \"COM\", past recordings and materials, etc. |\n| ANNOUNCE  New Staff Announcements | [Welcome](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/welcome) | **Public channel in STAFF team** for announcing and welcoming new staff members. |\n\n## Channel naming conventions\n\nAny Mattermost staff member can create, rename and archive channels on the pre-release server. When channels don't contain sensitive information they should default to **Public channel in CONTRIBUTORS team** and welcome participation by contributors.\n\nFor example, the [Loc: Seattle](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/loc-seattle) channel can be joined any contributor, partner or staff member to socialize with our [community](../../contributors/contributors/community.md).\n\nWe trust our staff to use names that are fast, obvious, forgiving, and also to help our colleagues with constructive suggestions when names could be improved through iteration.\n\nThe following conventions are in place for channels with common purposes:\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th style=\"text-align:left\">Purpose</th>\n      <th style=\"text-align:left\">Naming Convention</th>\n      <th style=\"text-align:left\">Explanation</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">BUILD\n        <br />\n        <br />Translation Discussion</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">i18n: [LANGUAGE]</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\"><b>Public channel in CONTRIBUTORS team</b> for collaborating on translations\n        in different languages</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">BUILD\n        <br />\n        <br />Build EE with <a href=\"../../contributors/contributors/community.md\">community</a>\n      </td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">EE: [FEATURE]</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\"><b>Public channel in CONTRIBUTORS team</b> for openly discussing Enterprise\n        Edition features with the public</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">SOCIALIZE\n        <br />\n        <br />Discuss geographic locations</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">Loc: [CITY OR AREA NAME]</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">\n        <p><b>Public channel in CONTRIBUTORS team</b> for socializing with contributors\n          including staff, partners and technical contributors in specific geographies.</p>\n        <p>Use cases: Organize social and professional meet-ups</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">SUPPORT\n        <br />\n        <br />Support PS customers</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">PS: [Customer Name]</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\"><b>Private channel in CONTRIBUTORS team</b> Channel for Premier Support\n        customers engaging with senior Support Engineer</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">\n        <p>COLLABORATE</p>\n        <p>Work with partners</p>\n      </td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">Partner: [Partner Name]</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\"><b>Private channel in CONTRIBUTORS team</b> for discussions with close\n        partners and Mattermost staff</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">OPERATE\n        <br />\n        <br />Plan, review and iterate on company operations with MLT</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">MLT [TOPIC]</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\"><b>Private channel in STAFF team</b> for topic-specific channels for members\n        of <a href=\"groups.md#mattermost-leadership-team-mlt\">Mattermost Leadership Team</a> to\n        work on <a href=\"../operations/mlt-cadence/\">Mattermost cadence</a>, E.g.\n        MLT Daily, MLT R&amp;D, etc.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">OPERATE\n        <br />\n        <br />Plan, review and iterate on company operations with MLX</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">MLX [TOPIC]</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\"><b>Private channel in STAFF team</b> for topic-specific channels for members\n        of <a href=\"groups.md#mattermost-leadership-team-extended-mxt\">Mattermost Leadership Extended Team</a>.\n        E.g.

        "html": "<hr />\n<h2>description: Description of norms on Mattermost Community server</h2>\n<h1>Workplace</h1>\n<h2>What is the Mattermost community server?</h2>\n<p>The Mattermost community server runs the latest stable build of Mattermost's software, including all open source code for Mattermost Team Edition as well as commercial code for Mattermost Enterprise Edition.</p>\n<p>It has two objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide a workplace for Mattermost staff.</li>\n<li>Engage with our <a href=\"../../contributors/contributors/community.md\">communities</a>, including users, contributors and partners.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Mattermost community server is not a production server and has occasional downtime.</strong></p>\n<p>You can reach the server at:</p>\n<p>{% embed url=\"https://community.mattermost.com\" caption=\"\" %}</p>\n<p>The server is also available via the following URLs, primarily used to test pre-release features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://community-release.mattermost.com\">https://community-release.mattermost.com</a>, which runs our upcoming stable release. This server includes work-in-progress features, and can contain bugs and have occasional downtime. This server receives regular pushes of features and/or bug fixes of the next release for testing purposes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://community-daily.mattermost.com\">https://community-daily.mattermost.com</a>, which runs latest builds of Mattermost's software, including all pre-release features of our core products. It is the most unstable version of the Mattermost community server. Bugs and occasional downtime is expected as this server receives daily pushes of features and/or bug fixes for testing purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The server has two teams:</p>\n<h3>Contributors team</h3>\n<p>URL: <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/core/messages/@github\">https://community.mattermost.com/core</a></p>\n<p>Available to anyone who'd like to join the server using either an email and password account (<a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/signup_user_complete\">you can sign-up for a free account online</a>) or a Mattermost staff account, which is set up via Okta and requires MFA either through Okta or Google Authenticator.</p>\n<h3>Staff team</h3>\n<p>URL: <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/fy21-devops-awareness\">https://community.mattermost.com/private-core</a></p>\n<p>A confidential space for <a href=\"../../contributors/contributors/community.md#mattermost-staff\">Mattermost staff</a> requiring a Mattermost Okta account and MFA.</p>\n<h4>Staff usernames on the Mattermost server</h4>\n<p>All Mattermost staff members hired after Jan 1, 2020 should have a username in the form of <code>@[FIRST_NAME]_[LAST_NAME]</code> for example \"Alice Evans\" should be <code>alice.evans</code>.</p>\n<p>If there are duplicate first name and last names, the new person added should add a middle initial in the form of <code>@[FIRST_NAME].[MIDDLE_INITIAL].[LAST_NAME]</code> for example, \"Alice Janice Evans\" who joined after the first Alice Evans would be <code>@alice.j.evans</code>.</p>\n<p>There are some user accounts that for legacy issues cannot use this format, for all other Mattermost staff--even those who joined before Jan 1 2020--should use the format that creates the most clarity.</p>\n<h4>Not mentioning staff while referring to them</h4>\n<p>By default, people's user names and first names trigger mention notifications in Mattermost. This can be distracting if people have the same first names, for example there are multiple people named \"Chris\" at Mattermost. If you want to mention someone without triggering a notification consider using their three letter initials, for example, \"Alice Emily Evans\" would be <code>AEE</code>.</p>\n<p>As an alternative to saying <code>@alice.evans</code> using <code>AEE</code> lets you refer to the person in passing without pushing an alert to them. For staff members that want to be alerted to even passing mentions of their name, they can opt in to that model by creating a <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/help/messaging/mentioning-teammates.html#words-that-trigger-mentions\">keyword notification</a> on their three letter initials.</p>\n<h2>Key channels for staff</h2>\n<p>The following table lists popular channels for Staff:</p>\n<p>| Purpose | Name | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| ANNOUNCE  Asynchronous Announcements | <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/announcements\">Announcements</a> | <strong>Public channel in STAFF team</strong> for making staff-wide announcements. |\n| ANNOUNCE  Synchronous Announcements | <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-cadence#customer-obsession-meeting-aka-com\">Customer Obsession Meeting</a> | <strong>Public channel in STAFF team</strong> for weekly all-staff meeting (see link in header for more info on \"COM\", past recordings and materials, etc. |\n| ANNOUNCE  New Staff Announcements | <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/welcome\">Welcome</a> | <strong>Public channel in STAFF team</strong> for announcing and welcoming new staff members. |</p>\n<h2>Channel naming conventions</h2>\n<p>Any Mattermost staff member can create, rename and archive channels on the pre-release server. When channels don't contain sensitive information they should default to <strong>Public channel in CONTRIBUTORS team</strong> and welcome participation by contributors.</p>\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/loc-seattle\">Loc: Seattle</a> channel can be joined any contributor, partner or staff member to socialize with our <a href=\"../../contributors/contributors/community.md\">community</a>.</p>\n<p>We trust our staff to use names that are fast, obvious, forgiving, and also to help our colleagues with constructive suggestions when names could be improved through iteration.</p>\n<p>The following conventions are in place for channels with common purposes:</p>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th style=\"text-align:left\">Purpose</th>\n      <th style=\"text-align:left\">Naming Convention</th>\n      <th style=\"text-align:left\">Explanation</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">BUILD\n        <br />\n        <br />Translation Discussion</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">i18n: [LANGUAGE]</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\"><b>Public channel in CONTRIBUTORS team</b> for collaborating on translations\n        in different languages</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">BUILD\n        <br />\n        <br />Build EE with <a href=\"../../contributors/contributors/community.md\">community</a>\n      </td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">EE: [FEATURE]</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\"><b>Public channel in CONTRIBUTORS team</b> for openly discussing Enterprise\n        Edition features with the public</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">SOCIALIZE\n        <br />\n        <br />Discuss geographic locations</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">Loc: [CITY OR AREA NAME]</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">\n        <p><b>Public channel in CONTRIBUTORS team</b> for socializing with contributors\n          including staff, partners and technical contributors in specific geographies.</p>\n        <p>Use cases: Organize social and professional meet-ups</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">SUPPORT\n        <br />\n        <br />Support PS customers</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">PS: [Customer Name]</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\"><b>Private channel in CONTRIBUTORS team</b> Channel for Premier Support\n        customers engaging with senior Support Engineer</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">\n        <p>COLLABORATE</p>\n        <p>Work with partners</p>\n      </td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">Partner: [Partner Name]</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\"><b>Private channel in CONTRIBUTORS team</b> for discussions with close\n        partners and Mattermost staff</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">OPERATE\n        <br />\n        <br />Plan, review and iterate on company operations with MLT</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">MLT [TOPIC]</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\"><b>Private channel in STAFF team</b> for topic-specific channels for members\n        of <a href=\"groups.md#mattermost-leadership-team-mlt\">Mattermost Leadership Team</a> to\n        work on <a href=\"../operations/mlt-cadence/\">Mattermost cadence</a>, E.g.\n        MLT Daily, MLT R&amp;D, etc.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">OPERATE\n        <br />\n        <br />Plan, review and iterate on company operations with MLX</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\">MLX [TOPIC]</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left\"><b>Private channel in STAFF team</b> for topic-specific channels for members\n        of <a href=\"groups.md#mattermost-leadership-team-extended-mxt\">Mattermost Leadership Extended Team</a>.\n        E.g.

This step should be completed within 5 business days after your laptop was received.\n\n#### Desktop \\(business computer\\)\n\nDesktops may be requested alongside a laptop for **engineering** roles. To request a desktop, email a request to your manager with the subject `Desktop for Approval`. Include IT for approval tracking by cc'ing daniel.sischy@mattermost.com. If your manager approves, a request should be sent to Joram Wilander, Director of Engineering, for budget review and need. If you receive both approvals, you may formally request a desktop through the [Desktop Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2_21Jllo8kztsnhhF_Xre9iOiPoeELUWwYziCDB25y68Wpw/viewform). Estimated delivery time will be communicated by IT once the order has been placed, but expect on average 1-4 week delivery window.\n\nWe offer three desktop options. The specifications below are those we believe are needed for you to do your best work at Mattermost, but they are not a hard ceiling. If you need upgraded specifications, outline them within the [Desktop Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2_21Jllo8kztsnhhF_Xre9iOiPoeELUWwYziCDB25y68Wpw/viewform).\n\n* **Mac:**\n  * Mac Studio\n  * M1 Ultra \\(20-core CPU, 48-core GPU, 32-core Neural Engine\\)\n  * 64GB unified memory\n  * 1TB SSD storage\n* **Windows:**\n  * Windows 11 Pro\n  * 13th Gen Intel Core i9-13900k \\(24-core, 32M Cache, 2.0 GHz to 5.2 GHz\\)\n  * 32GB 4800Mhz DDR5 memory\n  * 1TB M.2 PCIe NVMe\n* **Linux:**\n  * Ubuntu 20.04\n  * Intel Xeon Silver 4216 \\(16-core, 22MB Cache, 2.10 GHz to 3.20 GHz\\)\n  * 32GB 2666Mhz DDR4 memory\n  * 1 TB M.2, PCIe NVMe\n\nAs with other computer devices, once your desktop is received, you're required to register it by completing an [Asset Registration Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfesCJ-XMvXjBxeAYJxvzzbvZHnSv2rH9I48IioJrURNhd7Eg/viewform). This step should be completed within 5 business days after your desktop was received.\n\n### Other computer technology\n\nIf you need a device other than a laptop or mobile phone for your role, you should have a business use reason for the device and authorization from your manager before purchasing. If both are satisfied, you can proceed with purchasing the device on your own or [open an IT ticket](https://helpdesk.mattermost.com/) and the IT team will purchase this for you.\n\nAfter you obtain the asset, it's necessary to register your hardware by completing the [Asset Registration Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfesCJ-XMvXjBxeAYJxvzzbvZHnSv2rH9I48IioJrURNhd7Eg/viewform) if any one or more of the following criteria are met:\n\n* The cost of the device is 1,000 USD or greater.\n* The device contains company data and has access to company credentials.\n* The device contains customer data, confidential company information, or personally identifiable information \\(PII\\).\n\nIf you purchased the device on your own and you're submitting an expense report for reimbursement, attach the Asset Registration email confirmation with your expense report. This step should be completed within 5 business days after your device was received. Any registered device will need to be returned to Mattermost if you leave the company, or may be eligible to be kept if it falls under the [Hardware buyback policy](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/it/hardware-buy-back-policy)\n\n#### Hardware\n\nIf you require a tablet or phone as part of your role, or you participate in an on-call rotation, you may be eligible for a Mattermost-provided phone. Company phones are not mandatory. Using personal phones for business is an endorsed and acceptable practice; however, if a company phone is preferred, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Get approval from your direct manager.\n2. With your manager's approval and business justification, [open a ticket](https://helpdesk.mattermost.com/) with the required device: iOS Phone/Tablet, Android Phone/Tablet, etc.\n3. A member of IT will reach out to coordinate the purchase and delivery of the requested device.\n\n**Note:** On average, devices will be 2 generations behind the newest available model. \n\n#### Mobile device management \\(MDM\\)\n\nIn order to protect company information, usage of a Mobile Device Management \\(MDM\\) solution is mandatory for a company provided phone. An MDM must not be configured when using a personal phone.\n\nWhen the device has been lost, the MDM solution enables the company to remotely wipe the phone to ensure protection of customer data and additionally enforce security policies on the device.\n\n#### Process\n\nEach employee can order the hardware and subscription if they're part of an eligible group. Afterwards expense it according to the current process, once for the hardware, and each month for the subscription.\n\nAfter the hardware is received, it's mandatory to register with our Mobile Device Management \\(MDM\\) provider following this process \\[link pending\\] and our [Asset Registration Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfesCJ-XMvXjBxeAYJxvzzbvZHnSv2rH9I48IioJrURNhd7Eg/viewform). This must be completed within 5 business days after the device was received.\n\nThe employee is allowed to request a new mobile device every three years according to the current mobile device policy. Earlier replacement is possible if the device is damaged or otherwise prevents required business usage.\n\nWhen the work relationship between a staff member and the company ends the company device may be eligible to be kept under the [Hardware buy back policy](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/it/hardware-buy-back-policy)\n\n#### Acceptable use\n\nThe company device may only be used for work-related purposes. Personal usage is explicitly discouraged outside of emergency situations. Mattermost is not responsible for any personal data loss upon a remotely-initiated device wipe.\n\n### Equipment replacement\n\n#### Laptop\n\nMany staff members will use their company issued laptop until it breaks. That said, if your productivity is suffering, you can request a new laptop at any time [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe7DV-dt1K4G2UtVszjK78iRZD5i_ubhRk3xkUKnEemcyyELw/viewform). The average timeframe for equipment replacement is approximately three years. Old laptops fall under the [Hardware Buy Back Policy](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/it/hardware-buy-back-policy). Replacement laptops should follow the registration process similar to new hires by completing our [Asset Registration Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfesCJ-XMvXjBxeAYJxvzzbvZHnSv2rH9I48IioJrURNhd7Eg/viewform).\n\n#### Other\n\nPurchase as you need. We expect *most* items to have 18 to 24 month life and would expect additional purchases.\n\n### Software systems\n\nAll software should be provisioned through a corporate account. This helps mitigate multiple accounts for the same application. To see software Mattermost currently subscribes to, join the [Systems channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/systems) and click on **View & Request Access to Systems** in the header.\n\nIf there's a piece of software you're looking to buy that Mattermost does not have a subscription to, discuss with your manager and then [Create a ticket](https://helpdesk.mattermost.com/) to discuss with IT. All committed or material subscription requests should follow the instructions to purchase by [submitting a PO](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/purchasing/how-to-procure-a-vendor-contract).\n\nIf you are seeking to test a new software and it is not a material cost or comittment \\(e.g. a month-to-month cloud hosted software\\), the most expedient method may be requesting a [Virtual credit card](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/purchasing/airbase/how-to-submit-a-virtual-card-request). Reach out to the [Purchases](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/purchases) channel. Please note that IT will need to be provisioned an account to any new software solution to properly audit and administrate access.\n\nNote that any software expensed that has not been vetted through Procurement will not be reimbursed. Should you have questions, reach out to the [Purchases](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/purchases) channel.\n\n### Approved Vendors\n\nThe approved vendor list is a list of vendors IT has reviewed and approved for work use based on our Legal and Security compliance requirements. We understand that there may be a product you would like to use as a part of your work setup, the current list is not a hard limit. If a vendor you wish to purchase is not listed, please open an [IT ticket](https://helpdesk.mattermost.com/) and the IT team will review, make a determination, and if approved add the vendor to the whitelist. \n\nPlease see the current list of approved vendors below:\n\n* Apple\n* Anker\n* APC\n* Amazon Basics\n* Acer\n* Asus\n* Audio Technica\n* Bose\n* BenQ\n* Corsair\n* Cisco\n* Dell\n* DisplayLink\n* Gigabyte\n* Intel\n* JBL\n* Jabra\n* Lenovo\n* Logitech\n* LG\n* Microsoft\n* MSI\n* Netgear\n* Panasonic\n* Philips\n* Razer\n* Rode\n* Shure\n* Skullcandy\n* Satechi\n* Startech\n* SteelSeries\n* Samsung\n* Sennheiser\n* Sony\n* Targus\n* Toshiba\n* Ugreen\n\n\n",

To request a desktop, email a request to your manager with the subject <code>Desktop for Approval</code>. Include IT for approval tracking by cc'ing daniel.sischy@mattermost.com. If your manager approves, a request should be sent to Joram Wilander, Director of Engineering, for budget review and need.

        "content": "# Transfers and Promotions\n\nWe want staff to feel empowered to do the best work of their careers at Mattermost and enabled to drive the direction of their own growth trajectories at Mattermost.\n\n## What's the difference between a transfer and a promotion?\n\n* Transfers occur when a team member moves to a new team or function and owns a different set of [AORs](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/areas-of-responsibility). For example, a Customer Support Engineer transferring to a Product Manager role.\n* Promotions occur when a team member increases in level within the same team or function. For example, an SDE I being promoted to SDE II.\n\n### Process for Transfers\n\nInternal transfers have an informal and a formal component.\n\nInformally, a team member is encouraged to be curious and seek to learn about other roles, teams, projects, and Hiring Managers. Managers or MLT may also initiate a transfer conversation as part of general organization and team planing.\n\nWhen a team member and Hiring Manager agree that a potential transfer may be a good fit, the Hiring Manager should discuss a potential transfer with the team member's current Manager as well as HR to kick off the formal transfer process.\n\nDepending on the new role, there may be a need to assess skillset. This will be determined and communicated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe goal of this discussion is to:\n\n* Confirm headcount requirement exists.\n* Assess organizational impact \\(e.g. needs of team, product, and company\\).\n* Check for performance blindspots.\n* Address skillset transition \\(e.g. current level and experience within level and the new level, as well as any additional experience required for the role\\).\n* Allow HR to confirm potential compensation impact, especially if the transition results in a decrease in compensation.\n* Create a transition plan that balances the needs above with an aligned timeline.\n\n### Process for Promotions\n\n**Cadence**\n\nLevel changes are reviewed and discussed during every [performance review cycle](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/performance-reviews-50?q=levels). As such, promotions typically happen once a year during the [Winter Performance Review cycle](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/performance-reviews-50/performance-review-timeline-winter-2019). Managers and staff are also encouraged to discuss growth and development opportunities throughout the year.\n\n**Off-cycle cadence**\n\nOff-cycle promotions may also occur based on business need. This is typically determined if a [new job need exists](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#how-to-open-a-new-role). Staff members can express interest in being considered for an [open role](https://mattermost.com/careers/) by reaching out to the Hiring Manager. Similar to transfers, depending on the new role, there may be a need to assess skillset. This will be determined and communicated on a case-by-case basis, and will typically involve components of the internal interview process.\n\n**Manager and above promotions**\n\nManagers are responsible for ensuring alignment across the org and within their own team. Managers play a significant role in their teams and direct report's careers at Mattermost. It's important that every newly-hired or promoted Manager fully understands the role and responsibilities of Managers at Mattermost, and that they're set up for success to meet or exceed future role expectations. We assess every management level based on the [Mattermost Leadership Principles](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles).\n\n* Promotions to Manager will typically follow the typical internal interview process.\n* Promotions to Director will typically include interviews with the CEO and CTO.\n\n### Typical Internal Interview Process\n\nHiring Managers and MLT will determine what the skillset assessment process will be for an internal promotion or transfer. The typical process here is intended to outline the various components of an internal transition. This process should also occur after the discussion topics listed above have taken place with approval from the Team MLT.\n\n1. Hiring Manager and MLT should confirm that the new role need exists and confirm [any new headcount requests](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#how-to-open-a-new-role) that may be needed. Example: if a staff member is interviewing for a new role, the staff member's current role may require a backfill. This backfill headcount will need to be [approved as a new headcount request](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#how-to-open-a-new-role).\n2. Hiring Manager to work with Recruiting to develop the [Role Description](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#role-description) and [interview panel focus areas](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#interview-process). The Role Description should be shared with the staff member and interview panel.\n3. The Recruiter will set up the interview times for the staff member and the interview panel. Interviewers will be asked to [submit feedback & provide an interview rating](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#interview-panel-process) through Lever or through Mattermost.\n4. The Recruiter will incorporate the [mid-interview sync](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#mid-interview-sync) with the interview feedback and share with the Hiring Manager, Team MLT, and [AA](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#as-appropriate-interviews-aas) ahead of these interviews.\n5. Final interview decisions will determine the next steps.\n   * If the Hiring Manager, Team MLT, and the staff member want to proceed with the transfer, the Hiring Manager and Team MLT will work with HR to determine compensation changes, transfer plan, timeline, and effective date.\n     * HR or the Team MLT will communicate the compensation to the staff member and handle the required paperwork to document the change.\n     * The Hiring Manager and staff member will also have a discussion to set expectations on [AORs](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/areas-of-responsibility) - both new and transitioning.\n   * If the Hiring Manager, Team MLT, or staff member decide to not proceed with the transfer, the Hiring Manager will communicate this to the staff member. As part of this communication, the Hiring Manager may suggest opportunities for mentorship and continued learning in specific areas as it relates to the role. Your manager may suggest opportunities to level up your skillset, including a potential Mattermost Mentor, external courses, or assignment of new projects or tasks.\n\n### Mattermost Leadership Mentors\n\nMattermost Leadership Mentors is an informal, voluntary, and customizable program and method of [Learning, Mastering, and Teaching](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#learn-master-teach) at Mattermost. Mentors help guide and enable the development of a Mentee's behaviors, skillsets and/or mindsets. Mentees should bring a willingness and eagerness for their own development, and be ready to invest time in the Mentor-Mentee partnership.\n\n### Side Projects\n\nStaff are permitted to engage in side projects as long as the side project doesn't pose a conflict of interest with Mattermost projects and doesn't interfere with Mattermost work \\(e.g., doesn't involve the development of any technologies, infrastructure, or other material information that could be similar to Mattermost's business\\).\n\nBefore engaging in a side project, staff need to obtain written approval from Mattermost. To request approval, staff should email a request to hr@mattermost.com and their Manager. In the request, include a brief summary of the nature of your side project. The summary should include:\n\n* Expected time commitment.\n* Description of services provided.\n* Whether or not this work will be paid.\n",

        "content": "# Total Rewards\n\n## Total Rewards Strategy\n\nOur goal is to have a total rewards strategy that enables us to achieve the following:\n\n1. Attract our ideal candidates (best cultural fit and the best fit for the role).\n2. Align with local market compensation by paying similar compensation to comparably sized organizations in each local market.\n3. Support growth and retention by adopting a longer term view of reward and recognition.\n\n## Total Rewards principles \n\nAt Mattermost, decisions on compensation are guided by these three principles:\n\n1. Data driven (pay decisions based on external and internal benchmarks).\n2. Consistency (pay decisions guided by defined compensation frameworks to drive pay equity).\n3. Clarity (decisions that clearly align with our total rewards strategy).\n\nTo learn more about how the total rewards guiding principles drive equitable and consistent compensation decisions, as well as how we approach compensation, please refer to the resources listed below:\n\n- Video: Our approach to compensation: [Video Link](https://mattermost.zoom.us/rec/share/5pATCWceLN1Z_LQuOwtWkscRFybXD8EF-SUFp9rqTgwd3OmljOpqsfEULxiBX0zW.tNwvtB2SP15OlkEU?startTime=1655086943000); [Passcode](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lGj5XIuyVIMlyRjzXzM2juD5rhVe85nuOWZ6cqFyYpE/edit?usp=sharing)\n- Slides: Our approach to compensation: [Link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sktnALj-FUffGE2HgywADwpSvWJRiEYqMrMHLAZihiE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## How we determine compensation\n\nWe adopt a total rewards approach to compensation, so our package includes a mix of extrinsic and intrinsic rewards to enable each and every staff member to have the best work of their careers at Mattermost. The components of our total rewards package include base salary, performance pay, benefits, work-life programs, and a work environment that supports growth and development.\n\nTo ensure that salaries are consistent, equitable and competitive, our compensation system defines salary ranges (minimum and maximum salaries) for the purpose of administering compensation. The salary ranges are based on the following factors:\n\n1. Role and [level](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D8cGVMvLv4qKSpev7R3_DqEeiry-uKCjVdwbCTTgA0I/edit?usp=sharing)\n2. Cost of labor (local market compensation)\n3. Experience within level\n\n**Role and level**\n\nOur compensation system aims to position salary for each role and level, at or around the median of Mattermost\u2019s labor market, which comprises companies in the technology industry that are similar in terms of size and growth stage.\n\n**Local market compensation** \n\nWe pay competitive local market rates. This means that our compensation system targets pay at or around the median salaries of comparable organizations in the local market.  \n \nTo ensure a thorough understanding of the global labour market, we analyzed multiple data sources to establish differentials in the cost of labour and cost of living across 12,000 cities in 139 countries in order to create a zone approach versus a unique geo approach where compensation is differentiated by city. The zone approach enables us to group locations with similar cost of labour and cost of living into the same pay zone with a shared compensation range, thereby enhancing our ability to offer equitable and competitive compensation across our staff locations. \n\n**Experience within level**\n\nEach salary range is broken into four quarters, representing different competency levels i.e. new to role, learning, mastering or teaching. A staff member\u2019s pay level within the salary range i.e. quarter-placement, will vary depending on the career stage, and will generally follow the following guidelines:\n\n- _**New to role (partially meets expectations)**_\n\nThis is the lowest quarter of the salary range (up to 25% range penetration). This portion of the range applies to staff members that are new to the job and/or field, have little or no direct, related prior experience, and are still building the skills, knowledge, and ability to handle job responsibilities. The staff member at this point is not yet performing the full scope of the job requirements.\n\n- _**Learning (generally meets expectations)**_\n\nThis is the second quarter of the salary range (25% to 50% range penetration). This portion of the range applies to staff members that are deep into the learning curve for the role and performing job responsibilities effectively. The staff member at this point possesses all of the base knowledge and skill requirements, but may still be learning some aspects of the job or developing expertise.\n\n- _**Mastering (fully functioning and often exceeds expectations)**_\n\nThis is the third quarter of the salary range (50% to 75% range penetration). This portion of the range applies to staff members that are exhibiting the core competencies of the position, performing all tasks effectively and independently, and often exceeding expectations.\n\n- _**Teaching (consistently exceeds expectations)**_\n\nThis is the highest quarter of the salary range (75% to 100% range penetration). This portion of the range applies to staff members with unique talent and extensive experience. The staff is a subject matter expert with a depth of knowledge that extends beyond primary responsibilities. Ready for promotion to the next level when the opportunity arises.\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n**What if my candidate's current compensation and/or expected compensation is materially higher than the recommendation from our Total Rewards System?**\n\nOur compensation benchmarks are based on a deep analysis of multiple market data sources and reflect a competitive offering for our size, stage (development stage, funding round/amount), and industry. If a candidate's current compensation expectations materially exceed the range, the candidate may not be a fit for the company.\n\n**What if I disagree with the compensation recommendation from our Total Rewards System?**\n\nAny disagreement should be resolved within approximately 3 business days. If you disagree with our Total Rewards approach and the answers within this frequently asked questions page, please work with your MLT leader to share your viewpoint in writing with our Total Rewards Manager including, a) whether you disagree with one or more of our principles (being data driven, being consistent, and/or clearly aligning decisions with our model), b) list any data points you feel should be considered, c) share any other context on the disagreement.\n \nIf the disagreement can\u2019t be resolved in approximately one business day with our Total Rewards Manager, please escalate to our Head of HR with your point of view in writing, followed by a meeting with you, our Total Rewards Manager and our Head of HR.\n \nIf the disagreement with our Head of HR cannot be resolved in 1 business day, please escalate to our CEO with your point of view in writing, which will be followed by a conversation with you and our HR leader and CEO will make the final decision.\n\n**How do we know if our Total Rewards Strategy is correct?**\n\nAesthetically our Total Rewards Strategy should be at market rates for similar roles, levels and caliber at similar companies and similar local markets. In sampling compensation ranges we should see about half the sample at or below our range, and half the sample above our range.\n\n**I know of a company that pays more for the same role in the same city; can we change our Total Rewards Strategy to match that data point?**\n\nNo. We expect to pay market rates. For the same type of role, level and geography in a similar type of company we expect half the market to be paying at or below our compensation bands and the other half above our compensation bands. To change our Total Rewards calibration we would need to see a balanced sample of data points and incorporate the data with the multiple compensation survey data sources we subscribe to.\n\n**How does our Total Rewards system account for inflation?**\n\nWe account for inflation through analysis of changes in local market compensation by role and level. We use local market compensation as a benchmark incorporating the other inflationary benchmarks (energy, housing, etc.) impacting our staff members. In recommending a compensation change, the total rewards system considers external competitiveness, i.e. local market rates for similar roles at comparably sized organizations; market salary movements, i.e. salary increases at similar companies; internal pay equity; individual performance; and the staff member\u2019s experience within the grade level, i.e. whether they are at the beginning of the learning curve or at the expert level for the role.\n\n**How frequently should a staff member\u2019s compensation be reviewed?**\n\nCompensation reviews occur once a year as part of the end of year review cycle or as part of the mid-year review cycle if the criteria for [cycle 1](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/performance-reviews-50/midyear-performance-review-timeline-2020) reviews are met. There are instances where a manager may want to request for off-cycle compensation reviews, e.g. due to an unforeseen issue or due to a gap in planning. Off-cycle review requests are exceptions and would ideally only occur to address an urgent business need that cannot wait until the next performance review cycle. When an off-cycle review is requested, the HR team, CEO and company co-founders review the cause of the change and may conduct a post-mortem discussion and next actions to avoid off-cycle exceptions in future and present a summary to the compensation committee at the next Mattermost Board meeting in the context of pay equity governance during its closed session.\n\n**Why do we differentiate compensation based on location?**\n\nAlignment to local market compensation is a part of our total rewards philosophy as it allows the company to offer compensation that is competitive in each market. As an illustration, if Mattermost had office locations in different countries, then it would be reasonable to expect that the staff members in each location are paid similar salaries as other comparable employers in that location. Local market compensation also enables the company to offer an equitable standard of living for all staff. For example, if a staff member in California was paid the same salary as a staff member in Spain, the staff in California may fall under a lower standard of living bracket, while the staff member in Spain may fall under a higher standard of living bracket, relative to their respective local markets and the corresponding prices of goods and services.\n\n**What\u2019s the right way to think about our Total Rewards system in meeting my managerial goals?**\n\nTotal Rewards is taking an integrated view of a staff member\u2019s conceptual and concrete benefits. In working with the Total Rewards team, managers should have a \u201cTotal Rewards view\u201d from their direct report\u2019s perspective on the overall benefits of working in their role at Mattermost versus at other organizations.\n\nConceptual benefits are about impact (the ability to make a difference, to influence decisions, to change the trajectory of our business and results), growth (the ability to learn, master and teach, to take on a broader scope, to learn from colleagues and rotate responsibilities), and connection (building lifelong relationships inside and outside the company in the context of our work and mission).\n \nConcrete benefits include short term compensation (cash compensation, GTM variable bonuses, special recognition bonuses), long term compensation (company equity), benefits (including health insurance and other benefits or subsidies depending on region or country), and \u201csomething special\u201d (training, development experiences, mentorship, etc.)\n",

        "content": "# Relocations\n\nOne of the principles of Mattermost\u2019s Remote First culture is the ability to work from anywhere. Working from anywhere means more time with loved ones, no commute, and the ability to control everything about your workspace. Staff agreements are conditioned upon the country/region of residence noted in a staff member\u2019s contract. Location change requests/relocations should be discussed with HR and your MLT member as there may be time zone or location requirements for specific roles and teams. Staff must receive written approval from the company prior to a country or region relocation.\n\nMattermost does not sponsor work visas. In order to relocate, staff members must be eligible to work in their desired country/region of residence without sponsorship (unless requested to relocate by Mattermost to fulfill a specific business need).\n\n**Address change**\n\nIn most cases, moves within the same region/country do not require MLT and HR approval. Staff members should update their new address in BambooHR. Managers will be notified of the update via BambooHR and are responsible for approving the request which triggers HR updates to other systems where applicable. \nIntrastate (US) or intraprovincial (Canada) relocations follow the Relocation Request Process and require MLT and HR approval.\n\n**Short Term Travel (less than 6 months)**\n\nIn most cases, FT staff are able to travel and work outside of their contractual region/location for a period of less than 6 months in a 12 month period (time away from one\u2019s contractual location does not need to be consecutive - rather it\u2019s 6 months total in any 12 month period).\n\nStaff members are responsible for ensuring they have the necessary permits and documentation to work legally and must get manager approval prior to traveling. HR should be notified if travel extends beyond a 6 month period and will follow the relocation request process and review, requiring MLT and HR approval.\n\nSome roles are not eligible to work outside of their contractual region/location. Reach out to HR for more information.\n\n**Relocation policy**\n\nFT staff that wish to relocate outside of their contractual region/location for a period of 6 months or longer require MLT and HR approval and follow the Relocation Request Process.\n\n1. Team member to seek manager approval for relocation.\n2. Manager to determine whether: (i) Mattermost is open to hire in the desired location; (b) the time zone shift (if applicable) can be supported by the team/role (where applicable); and (iii) the role is needed in the desired location (where applicable).\n3. Manager to initiate relocation review by completing the [Request for Relocation Form](https://na3.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=87cb016a-463c-40ab-8e56-24a5d7918c13&env=na3&acct=533bad41-ea71-442d-b8aa-6b3d45e971d6&v=2).\n4. MLT, HR, and Total Rewards to advise on next steps, including compensation review where applicable.\n",

Staff agreements are conditioned upon the country/region of residence noted in a staff member\u2019s contract. Location change requests/relocations should be discussed with HR and your MLT member as there may be time zone or location requirements for specific roles and teams. Staff must receive written approval from the company prior to a country or region relocation.</p>\n<p>Mattermost does not sponsor work visas. In order to relocate, staff members must be eligible to work in their desired country/region of residence without sponsorship (unless requested to relocate by Mattermost to fulfill a specific business need).</p>\n<p><strong>Address change</strong></p>\n<p>In most cases, moves within the same region/country do not require MLT and HR approval. Staff members should update their new address in BambooHR. Managers will be notified of the update via BambooHR and are responsible for approving the request which triggers HR updates to other systems where applicable. \nIntrastate (US) or intraprovincial (Canada) relocations follow the Relocation Request Process and require MLT and HR approval.</p>\n<p><strong>Short Term Travel (less than 6 months)</strong></p>\n<p>In most cases, FT staff are able to travel and work outside of their contractual region/location for a period of less than 6 months in a 12 month period (time away from one\u2019s contractual location does not need to be consecutive - rather it\u2019s 6 months total in any 12 month period).</p>\n<p>Staff members are responsible for ensuring they have the necessary permits and documentation to work legally and must get manager approval prior to traveling. HR should be notified if travel extends beyond a 6 month period and will follow the relocation request process and review, requiring MLT and HR approval.</p>\n<p>Some roles are not eligible to work outside of their contractual region/location. Reach out to HR for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>Relocation policy</strong></p>\n<p>FT staff that wish to relocate outside of their contractual region/location for a period of 6 months or longer require MLT and HR approval and follow the Relocation Request Process.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Team member to seek manager approval for relocation.</li>\n<li>Manager to determine whether: (i) Mattermost is open to hire in the desired location; (b) the time zone shift (if applicable) can be supported by the team/role (where applicable); and (iii) the role is needed in the desired location (where applicable).</li>\n<li>Manager to initiate relocation review by completing the <a href=\"https://na3.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=87cb016a-463c-40ab-8e56-24a5d7918c13&amp;env=na3&amp;acct=533bad41-ea71-442d-b8aa-6b3d45e971d6&amp;v=2\">Request for Relocation Form</a>.</li>\n<li>MLT, HR, and Total Rewards to advise on next steps, including compensation review where applicable.</li>\n</ol>",

        "title": "HR Cadences",
        "content": "# HR Cadences\n\nThis section outlines HR cadences for company wide operations.\n\n## Listening Sessions\n\nListening Sessions are 1:1 meetings with your HR partner. The intent of the HR Listening Session is to connect with each team member 1:1 for a general pulse check at the organization, team, and individual level. All feedback is welcome, and the conversation may often center around [likes and wishes](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#likes-and-wishes).\n\n**Why Listening Sessions?**\n\nOne-on-one Listening Sessions offer an opportunity to share feedback that some may not feel comfortable sharing in a group or public setting. Similarly, it's also a chance to share context that may help uncover [blindspots or brown m&ms](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#shoulder-check). The idea is to gather general themes as it varies across teams. Feedback is kept confidential, unless otherwise requested or agreed upon by or with the staff member. **Note:** There may be topics that HR is legally required to act on \\(e.g. bullying, harassment\\).\n\nFeedback themes help drive HR priorities, communication and/or clarification efforts, and even coaching opportunities for managers and leaders.\n\n**Cadence**\n\nThe goal is monthly for managers and quarterly for non-managers. Your HR partner will schedule time with you via Google Calendar. This may change due to HR team bandwidth. However, every staff member is encouraged to schedule time with someone on HR even if there isn't an existing scheduled meeting or if there\u2019s an urgent topic.\n\nManager listening sessions will happen once a month. In addition to the above topics, this is also an opportunity for people managers to unpack questions around people management challenges, concerns, and/or best practices. This feedback will also help drive future Manager training topics.\n\n## Async weeks\n\n**What are async weeks at Mattermost?**\n\nDuring an org-wide async week, all recurring meetings are canceled (e.g. COM, MBR, team-wide meetings, 1:1s) with the goal of:\n\n- **Creating space for heads-down time.** Meetings can be disruptive when our work requires deeper focus.\n- **Improving time zone agnostic practices, including: default document, default open mindsets.** We have team members across the globe and in multiple time zones, and when we're able to communicate and collaborate with web-discoverable documentation we better enable our global team members with access to information, context.\n- **Providing time for calendar clean-up.** We encourage every team member to use this as an opportunity to clean your calendar, and respectfully question if recurring meetings should be changed, canceled or alternate attendees.\n- **Testing and improving [Vacation-Ready](https://community.mattermost.com/files/bd1x8f47abgdx83ejpesd1z7ce/public?h=EWRJ-lMoUotKhiPyPAJzS_6Zt2uyAmaJh08xHr8LIBU) Team preparedness.**\n\n**Async weeks: FAQ**\n\n- **Does async week mean that we aren't supposed to meet live at all?**\n\nLive meetings or calls do and should still happen, as appropriate. For example, our customer-facing teams may still have customer meetings or calls which can't be canceled. Others may be working on projects where a synchronous call or meeting helps our 'heads-down' work. We encourage every team member to use your best judgment.\n\n- **How do I effectively communicate while asynchronous?** \n\nWritten communication that is open is key. Examples include Mattermost group messages vs. DMs, web-discoverable: handbook, GDocs, Boards.\nUse simple language. We're a global company and encourage every team member to be mindful of words or idioms that don't translate beyond our region. Similarly, please ask questions when something doesn't translate, it may be a blindspot and your question can help expand awareness.\n\nAssume positive intent. Tone and intent can be very hard to read over text, and even zoom. When we assume there's positive intent, we're able to approach conversations with a more open, collaborative mindset, and ask follow-up questions to gain clarity.\n\n- **What are some other tips and best practices?** \n\nWe're asking all team members to take notes on your experience during our async weeks. The People team will send an experience feedback survey after each async week to understand what's working and where we can add clarity in the future.\n\n## New hire feedback\n\nPeople use [new hire feedback](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/onboarding#post-onboarding-readiness) to improve the onboarding process as it relates to general company onboarding. People may give suggestions to functional or department lead\\(s\\) if relevant feedback exists. New hire feedback cadences:\n\n## Staff Enablement Survey\n\nStaff enablement data provides a benchmark understanding of the level of enablement felt by staff in the workplace. This is also a predictor of satisfaction and business outcomes. Quantitative data is a starting point to gather qualitative data for customized action planning.\n\nMattermost uses Gallup\u2019s 12 Engagement questions to assess how enabled staff at Mattermost feel. The [Gallup](https://q12.gallup.com/Help/en-us/Answers/164468) research indicates 12 of the biggest indicators of high-performing teams in terms of critical outcomes such as productivity, profitability, safety, and recognition. We use all 12 questions because each topic is deeply important to the Mattermost staff experience.\n\nWe value high trust over micromanagement and want to continuously improve how we enable all staff to bring their best self to work. The bi-annual engagement survey helps HR, MLT, and Managers focus on high impact initiatives that mean the most to the staff experience.\n\nStaff enablement surveys are anonymous. To maintain the confidentiality of individuals and small groups, the reporting group minimum is 5 respondents. If a reporting group has fewer than 5 respondents, the group's Manager/Team MLT will receive departmental-level or company-level results only. The People Team will only share general themes gleaned from comments to maintain the confidentiality of respondents, no matter the size of the reporting group.  \n\n### Cadence\n\n* Every six months \\(in March and September\\).\n* [Additional logistics can be found here](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-cadence#staff-enablement-survey).\n* Post-action planning at team and company level.\n* Reporting group minimum of 5 responses is required for any reporting filters related to: Managers, Teams, etc. This is a commonly-used threshold that helps maintain anonymity of survey responses.\n\n### Staff Enablement Results\n\n* [March 2020 - Staff Engagement Survey](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bkUQOCvJyYX-695gpZI7SJal14AWefFx5fJQxTOJKlI/edit#slide=id.g730cbfe72a_0_9).\n\nFor additional information on Gallup [see the Gallup website](https://www.gallup.com/corporate/212381/who-we-are.aspx). You can review the list of questions ahead of taking the survey. Each question is important to Mattermost as it relates to our Leadership Principles, remote teams, and shared values of Trust, Growth, and Iteration.\n\n### Survey questions, explained\n\n#### **Q1: I know what is expected of me at Mattermost.**\n\nRole clarity and alignment is vital at any company. This is especially important for our remote teams and is a significant reason Mattermost uses a variety of methods to align expectations with individuals, within teams, and across teams. This includes performance reviews to discuss expectations and give feedback, [AORs](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms#aor) to help cross-team collaboration, project planning with clear [DRIs](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms#dri) that create transparency on roles within project teams, and QBRs that provide team and individual focus as it relates to Mattermost\u2019s Mission and Vision.\n\nRole clarity requires a continuous dialogue with one\u2019s Manager. In order to [earn](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles) and keep [trust](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDSaeW-M92gth_NM1vI23dtbFLBsYVIk/edit#slide=id.g6f3b66b1fb_0_352), conversations around expectations are important to avoid misalignment of expectations which can cause frustration, affect productivity, and result in performance issues.\n\n#### **Q2: I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right.**\n\nMattermost encourages staff to [customize their home workspace](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#equipment) to best fit individual needs.\n\nBeyond equipment and home office this can include any resource that would help optimize productivity and minimize distractions. Tools can include things like: systems, hardware, or internal documentation. There may not be a budget or resources available to approve every tool request but alternative or interim solutions should be a collaborative effort to [grow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDSaeW-M92gth_NM1vI23dtbFLBsYVIk/edit#slide=id.g6f3b66b1fb_0_352) our individual and team capabilities.\n\n#### **Q3: At Mattermost, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day.**\n\nBeing a Destination Workplace means each person is both willing and enabled to bring your best self to work. Many factors can affect one\u2019s willingness and enablement to do what you do best, like: internal motivation, work style, strengths, growth areas, onboarding, or internal training.\n\nWhen a Manager understands how each factor differs across a team they can [iterate](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDSaeW-M92gth_NM1vI23dtbFLBsYVIk/edit#slide=id.g6f3b66b1fb_0_352) task assignments or adjust working groups to improve team performance and [elevate team standards](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles) by leveraging individual strengths with alignment to business outcomes.\n\n#### **Q4. In the last seven days, I have received recognition or praise for doing good work.**\n\nRecognition preferences and expectations are different for every person and team. Appreciation and praise can be difficult to feel in a remote environment where physical indicators of celebration, like a high-five or the sound of a gong, aren\u2019t easy to replicate. However, being remote, asynchronous communication is a life-line and communicating recognition requires iteration and intent.\n\nIt\u2019s helpful to understand that recognition is a form of feedback that positively reinforces what success looks like. For example, public recognition helps clarify what [Mattermost\u2019s standards for success](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles) are with a tangible example. [Slow is smooth, smooth is fast](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#slow-is-smooth-smooth-is-fast) works best when we are able to pause and show appreciation for good work in order to foster alignment for [future growth](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDSaeW-M92gth_NM1vI23dtbFLBsYVIk/edit#slide=id.g6f3b66b1fb_0_352) at Mattermost.\n\n#### **Q5. My manager, or someone at Mattermost, seems to care about me as a person.**\n\nGallup\u2019s research translates \u201ccaring about me\u201d to mean \u201csetting me up for success.\u201d Although emphasis is always placed on someone\u2019s Manager offering support, it's also the support of teams, peers, and MLT that creates a welcoming sense of trust in an organization. When individuals, teams, and cross-team working groups feel supported, there\u2019s less hesitancy to innovate and [iterate](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDSaeW-M92gth_NM1vI23dtbFLBsYVIk/edit#slide=id.g6f3b66b1fb_0_352) with autonomy and [ownership](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles) and Mattermost, as a team, is able to be more productive.\n\n#### **Q6. There is someone at Mattermost who encourages my development.**\n\nEach person has a unique combination of knowledge, strengths, and capabilities. Encouraging one\u2019s development balances this understanding with mutual commitment and [self awareness](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles) from Manager and direct report determine what type of work or projects are viable opportunities to both leverage one\u2019s talent and foster additional learning in order to [grow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDSaeW-M92gth_NM1vI23dtbFLBsYVIk/edit#slide=id.g6f3b66b1fb_0_352) in the role at Mattermost.\n\n#### **Q7. At Mattermost, my opinions seem to count.**\n\nImproving how to enable staff to be part of the decisions that affect their work improves asynchronous communication, encourage innovation, [ownership](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles), and [iteration](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDSaeW-M92gth_NM1vI23dtbFLBsYVIk/edit#slide=id.g6f3b66b1fb_0_352).\n\nWhen opinions are asked for, and listened to, staff feel aligned with the issue and accept ownership of the solution. Even when a suggested solution is not the chosen solution, sharing context on the decision will help describe the complexity of an issue or highlight potential blindspots.\n\n#### **Q8. The mission or purpose of Mattermost makes me feel my job is important.**\n\nUnderstanding how one\u2019s work contributes to a larger mission is a cornerstone of engagement.\n\nWhen there is strong alignment with the Mission, [Mattermost Leadership Principles](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles) and role expectations, individuals are able to self prioritize their work, [iterate](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDSaeW-M92gth_NM1vI23dtbFLBsYVIk/edit#slide=id.g6f3b66b1fb_0_352) as needed, collaborate with impact, and earn the trust of their peers.\n\n#### **Q9. My associates or fellow staff are committed to doing quality work.**\n\nHigh performers are motivated to continue maintaining a high bar when they feel their peers and colleagues are similarly committed. Similarly, high performers can be motivated to not continue maintaining their high performance when they feel their peers or colleagues are not similarly committed.\n\nMaintaining high trust in a remote environment requires intent from every team member at Mattermost. We can't physically \u201csee\u201d someone\u2019s commitment to work, and micromanagement doesn\u2019t work with our [leadership principles](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles) or our culture of high trust.\n\nTo mitigate assumption-based thought, we want to focus on improving and communicating standards for asynchronous communications, transparent AORs, and empathetic remote norms \\(e.g. response times, time zones\\) as part of Mattermost\u2019s culture of high trust.\n\n#### **Q10. I have a best friend at Mattermost.**\n\nThe term \u201cbest friend\u201d is intended to mean **quality of work relationships**. Gallup intentionally uses this term because it pinpoints a dynamic of great workgroups.\n\nWhen camaraderie exists within and across teams, issues are more likely to be solved with greater ease, clarity, speed, and [trust](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles). [Gallup's research](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236213/why-need-best-friends-work.aspx) also shows that when camaraderie or a sense of affiliation is low, [high impact issues](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDSaeW-M92gth_NM1vI23dtbFLBsYVIk/edit#slide=id.g6f3b66b1fb_0_352) or problems that require partnership are more likely to be avoided, and less likely to be driven with positive actions that benefit the business and teams.\n\nIn addition to camaraderie within workgroups, we also care about fostering quality relationships with coworkers outside of workgroups. Socializing is physically difficult in a remote environment but not impossible. We have a great team of staff and contributors and want to support opportunities to create and build connections with team and community members around the world.\n\n#### **Q11. In the last six months, someone at Mattermost has talked to me about my progress.**\n\nPerformance reviews are completed once or twice a year, depending on the team's cadence. Individuals expect performance feedback at more frequent intervals but may not always ask for feedback directly.\n\nGiving and receiving feedback are often avoided because the topic is discomforting. Fostering the value of [iteration](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDSaeW-M92gth_NM1vI23dtbFLBsYVIk/edit#slide=id.g6f3b66b1fb_0_352) depends on the willingness to objectively hear and share feedback in order to grow individually, as a team, and at Mattermost.\n\n#### **Q12. This last year, I have had opportunities to grow at Mattermost.**\n\nMattermost is fast-paced and high trust and from a bird\u2019s-eye view there are multiple opportunities to learn, grow, and progress. The balance is seeing these opportunities and matching them to the individual characteristics of Q3 and Q7.\n\nHow to see the opportunities is an area we need to improve and make transparent so each person has access to what growth trajectories are available at Mattermost. The foundation of this begins with understanding [job levels](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kNsl7JUWDQ8MhWonys9dR3osrxEWYkKVIoECfFKSQzw/edit#gid=0).\n\nUnderstanding where you are today and what the next step may be improves transparency to opportunities. Matching your unique talent combination with work is a team effort between an individual, manager, and Mattermost.\n\n#### **Q13. How likely are you to recommend Mattermost as a place to work?**\n\nStaff Net Promoter Score \\(SNPS\\) is a health index measuring overall engagement, happiness, and loyalty. SNPS is a common indicator of attrition, both voluntary and involuntary. Understanding how Promoters, Detractors, and Passives rate each category gives us, Mattermost, an opportunity to retain talent, improve performance, and enhance the staff experience.\n\n#### **Q14. Select Direct Manager.**\n\nTeam summary survey responses will be shared across the company. Managers with more than five direct reports, and responses, will receive summary data from their team. Team MLT members and Team Leads will decide on the appropriate group for the Post-survey team discussions and action planning.\n\n#### **Q.15 & Q.16. What Leadership Principle Does your Manager Most and Least Embody?**\n\nThese questions give Managers insight on behaviors that are positively observed or role-modeled, so they can better understand which behaviors to continue, as well as opportunities to grow. Also, in the spirit of [Learn, Master, Teach](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#learn-master-teach), Managers can help share best practices as it relates to leadership principles they may strongly embody.\n\n### Post-COM survey analysis\n\nAfter the survey analysis is presented at [COM](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-cadence#customer-obsession-meeting-aka-com), HR will share Team Enablement Results with MLT and Managers, as long as there are at least five submitted responses. HR will work with MLT or the Team Lead to focus on relevant and actionable results based on the feedback. Next, MLT or Team Leads will share and discuss any next steps with the team.\n\nPost-survey actions start with team conversations and may include pulse surveys and listening sessions to help contextualize feedback and uncover blindspots. With bi-annual surveys, post-survey action planning should be iterative throughout the year.\n\n## Pulse Surveys\n\nFor the second half of 2023, we will be taking frequent *pulse checks* via mini engagment surveys. The purpose of the pulse engagement surveys is to gain meaningful insights into staff sentiments and engagement levels, to maintain a flow of continuous feedback, and to measure the impact of post-survey engagement initiatives. \n\nThe bi-monthly pulse surveys will ask the following 6 core engagement questions:\n- The leaders at Mattermost have communicated a vision that motivates me\n- I know how my work contributes to Mattermost's goals\n- I know what I need to do to be successful in my role\n- I am appropriately involved in decisions that affect my work\n- I believe there are good career opportuntities for me at Mattermost\n- I would recommend Mattermost as a great place to work\n\nBased on the results, the People Team and/or your team leadership will follow up with action items which could include things like [listening sessions](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/hr-cadences#listening-sessions) or [listening tours](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-cadence#ceo-listening-tours) to help us gain a deeper understanding of how individuals and teams are feeling. The initiatives may be org-wide or department specific and the People Team will work closely with managers to action the results. The confidentiality rules and reporting group minimums of Enablement Surveys apply to Pulse Engagement Surveys. Department-level feedback will be shared with the respective Team MLX and Team MLT, and only general themes gleaned from comments will be shared to maintain the confidentiality of respondents. \n\n### Pulse Survey Dates\n- **June 2023** | June 22, 2023 - June 28, 2023\n- **September 2023** | September 28, 2023 - October 4, 2023\n- **December 2023** | December 7, 2023 - December 13, 2023\n",
        "html": "<h1>HR Cadences</h1>\n<p>This section outlines HR cadences for company wide operations.</p>\n<h2>Listening Sessions</h2>\n<p>Listening Sessions are 1:1 meetings with your HR partner. The intent of the HR Listening Session is to connect with each team member 1:1 for a general pulse check at the organization, team, and individual level. All feedback is welcome, and the conversation may often center around <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#likes-and-wishes\">likes and wishes</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Listening Sessions?</strong></p>\n<p>One-on-one Listening Sessions offer an opportunity to share feedback that some may not feel comfortable sharing in a group or public setting. Similarly, it's also a chance to share context that may help uncover <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#shoulder-check\">blindspots or brown m&amp;ms</a>. The idea is to gather general themes as it varies across teams. Feedback is kept confidential, unless otherwise requested or agreed upon by or with the staff member. <strong>Note:</strong> There may be topics that HR is legally required to act on (e.g. bullying, harassment).</p>\n<p>Feedback themes help drive HR priorities, communication and/or clarification efforts, and even coaching opportunities for managers and leaders.</p>\n<p><strong>Cadence</strong></p>\n<p>The goal is monthly for managers and quarterly for non-managers. Your HR partner will schedule time with you via Google Calendar. This may change due to HR team bandwidth. However, every staff member is encouraged to schedule time with someone on HR even if there isn't an existing scheduled meeting or if there\u2019s an urgent topic.</p>\n<p>Manager listening sessions will happen once a month. In addition to the above topics, this is also an opportunity for people managers to unpack questions around people management challenges, concerns, and/or best practices. This feedback will also help drive future Manager training topics.</p>\n<h2>Async weeks</h2>\n<p><strong>What are async weeks at Mattermost?</strong></p>\n<p>During an org-wide async week, all recurring meetings are canceled (e.g. COM, MBR, team-wide meetings, 1:1s) with the goal of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Creating space for heads-down time.</strong> Meetings can be disruptive when our work requires deeper focus.</li>\n<li><strong>Improving time zone agnostic practices, including: default document, default open mindsets.</strong> We have team members across the globe and in multiple time zones, and when we're able to communicate and collaborate with web-discoverable documentation we better enable our global team members with access to information, context.</li>\n<li><strong>Providing time for calendar clean-up.</strong> We encourage every team member to use this as an opportunity to clean your calendar, and respectfully question if recurring meetings should be changed, canceled or alternate attendees.</li>\n<li><strong>Testing and improving <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/files/bd1x8f47abgdx83ejpesd1z7ce/public?h=EWRJ-lMoUotKhiPyPAJzS_6Zt2uyAmaJh08xHr8LIBU\">Vacation-Ready</a> Team preparedness.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Async weeks: FAQ</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Does async week mean that we aren't supposed to meet live at all?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Live meetings or calls do and should still happen, as appropriate. For example, our customer-facing teams may still have customer meetings or calls which can't be canceled. Others may be working on projects where a synchronous call or meeting helps our 'heads-down' work. We encourage every team member to use your best judgment.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How do I effectively communicate while asynchronous?</strong> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Written communication that is open is key. Examples include Mattermost group messages vs. DMs, web-discoverable: handbook, GDocs, Boards.\nUse simple language. We're a global company and encourage every team member to be mindful of words or idioms that don't translate beyond our region. Similarly, please ask questions when something doesn't translate, it may be a blindspot and your question can help expand awareness.</p>\n<p>Assume positive intent. Tone and intent can be very hard to read over text, and even zoom. When we assume there's positive intent, we're able to approach conversations with a more open, collaborative mindset, and ask follow-up questions to gain clarity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What are some other tips and best practices?</strong> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>We're asking all team members to take notes on your experience during our async weeks. The People team will send an experience feedback survey after each async week to understand what's working and where we can add clarity in the future.</p>\n<h2>New hire feedback</h2>\n<p>People use <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/onboarding#post-onboarding-readiness\">new hire feedback</a> to improve the onboarding process as it relates to general company onboarding. People may give suggestions to functional or department lead(s) if relevant feedback exists. New hire feedback cadences:</p>\n<h2>Staff Enablement Survey</h2>\n<p>Staff enablement data provides a benchmark understanding of the level of enablement felt by staff in the workplace. This is also a predictor of satisfaction and business outcomes. Quantitative data is a starting point to gather qualitative data for customized action planning.</p>\n<p>Mattermost uses Gallup\u2019s 12 Engagement questions to assess how enabled staff at Mattermost feel. The <a href=\"https://q12.gallup.com/Help/en-us/Answers/164468\">Gallup</a> research indicates 12 of the biggest indicators of high-performing teams in terms of critical outcomes such as productivity, profitability, safety, and recognition. We use all 12 questions because each topic is deeply important to the Mattermost staff experience.</p>\n<p>We value high trust over micromanagement and want to continuously improve how we enable all staff to bring their best self to work. The bi-annual engagement survey helps HR, MLT, and Managers focus on high impact initiatives that mean the most to the staff experience.</p>\n<p>Staff enablement surveys are anonymous. To maintain the confidentiality of individuals and small groups, the reporting group minimum is 5 respondents. If a reporting group has fewer than 5 respondents, the group's Manager/Team MLT will receive departmental-level or company-level results only. The People Team will only share general themes gleaned from comments to maintain the confidentiality of respondents, no matter the size of the reporting group.  </p>\n<h3>Cadence</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Every six months (in March and September).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-cadence#staff-enablement-survey\">Additional logistics can be found here</a>.</li>\n<li>Post-action planning at team and company level.</li>\n<li>Reporting group minimum of 5 responses is required for any reporting filters related to: Managers, Teams, etc. This is a commonly-used threshold that helps maintain anonymity of survey responses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Staff Enablement Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bkUQOCvJyYX-695gpZI7SJal14AWefFx5fJQxTOJKlI/edit#slide=id.g730cbfe72a_0_9\">March 2020 - Staff Engagement Survey</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For additional information on Gallup <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/corporate/212381/who-we-are.aspx\">see the Gallup website</a>. You can review the list of questions ahead of taking the survey. Each question is important to Mattermost as it relates to our Leadership Principles, remote teams, and shared values of Trust, Growth, and Iteration.</p>\n<h3>Survey questions, explained</h3>\n<h4><strong>Q1: I know what is expected of me at Mattermost.</strong></h4>\n<p>Role clarity and alignment is vital at any company. This is especially important for our remote teams and is a significant reason Mattermost uses a variety of methods to align expectations with individuals, within teams, and across teams. This includes performance reviews to discuss expectations and give feedback, <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms#aor\">AORs</a> to help cross-team collaboration, project planning with clear <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms#dri\">DRIs</a> that create transparency on roles within project teams, and QBRs that provide team and individual focus as it relates to Mattermost\u2019s Mission and Vision.</p>\n<p>Role clarity requires a continuous dialogue with one\u2019s Manager. In order to <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles\">earn</a> and keep <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDSaeW-M92gth_NM1vI23dtbFLBsYVIk/edit#slide=id.g6f3b66b1fb_0_352\">trust</a>, conversations around expectations are important to avoid misalignment of expectations which can cause frustration, affect productivity, and result in performance issues.</p>\n<h4><strong>Q2: I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right.</strong></h4>\n<p>Mattermost encourages staff to <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#equipment\">customize their home workspace</a> to best fit individual needs.</p>\n<p>Beyond equipment and home office this can include any resource that would help optimize productivity and minimize distractions. Tools can include things like: systems, hardware, or internal documentation. There may not be a budget or resources available to approve every tool request but alternative or interim solutions should be a collaborative effort to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDSaeW-M92gth_NM1vI23dtbFLBsYVIk/edit#slide=id.g6f3b66b1fb_0_352\">grow</a> our individual and team capabilities.</p>\n<h4><strong>Q3: At Mattermost, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day.</strong></h4>\n<p>Being a Destination Workplace means each person is both willing and enabled to bring your best self to work. Many factors can affect one\u2019s willingness and enablement to do what you do best, like: internal motivation, work style, strengths, growth areas, onboarding, or internal training.</p>\n<p>When a Manager understands how each factor differs across a team they can <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDSaeW-M92gth_NM1vI23dtbFLBsYVIk/edit#slide=id.g6f3b66b1fb_0_352\">iterate</a> task assignments or adjust working groups to improve team performance and <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles\">elevate team standards</a> by leveraging individual strengths with alignment to business outcomes.</p>\n<h4><strong>Q4. In the last seven days, I have received recognition or praise for doing good work.</strong></h4>\n<p>Recognition preferences and expectations are different for every person and team. Appreciation and praise can be difficult to feel in a remote environment where physical indicators of celebration, like a high-five or the sound of a gong, aren\u2019t easy to replicate. However, being remote, asynchronous communication is a life-line and communicating recognition requires iteration and intent.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s helpful to understand that recognition is a form of feedback that positively reinforces what success looks like. For example, public recognition helps clarify what <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles\">Mattermost\u2019s standards for success</a> are with a tangible example. <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#slow-is-smooth-smooth-is-fast\">Slow is smooth, smooth is fast</a> works best when we are able to pause and show appreciation for good work in order to foster alignment for <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDSaeW-M92gth_NM1vI23dtbFLBsYVIk/edit#slide=id.g6f3b66b1fb_0_352\">future growth</a> at Mattermost.</p>\n<h4><strong>Q5.

Managers with more than five direct reports, and responses, will receive summary data from their team. Team MLT members and Team Leads will decide on the appropriate group for the Post-survey team discussions and action planning.</p>\n<h4><strong>Q.15 &amp; Q.16. What Leadership Principle Does your Manager Most and Least Embody?</strong></h4>\n<p>These questions give Managers insight on behaviors that are positively observed or role-modeled, so they can better understand which behaviors to continue, as well as opportunities to grow. Also, in the spirit of <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#learn-master-teach\">Learn, Master, Teach</a>, Managers can help share best practices as it relates to leadership principles they may strongly embody.</p>\n<h3>Post-COM survey analysis</h3>\n<p>After the survey analysis is presented at <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-cadence#customer-obsession-meeting-aka-com\">COM</a>, HR will share Team Enablement Results with MLT and Managers, as long as there are at least five submitted responses. HR will work with MLT or the Team Lead to focus on relevant and actionable results based on the feedback. Next, MLT or Team Leads will share and discuss any next steps with the team.</p>\n<p>Post-survey actions start with team conversations and may include pulse surveys and listening sessions to help contextualize feedback and uncover blindspots. With bi-annual surveys, post-survey action planning should be iterative throughout the year.</p>\n<h2>Pulse Surveys</h2>\n<p>For the second half of 2023, we will be taking frequent <em>pulse checks</em> via mini engagment surveys. The purpose of the pulse engagement surveys is to gain meaningful insights into staff sentiments and engagement levels, to maintain a flow of continuous feedback, and to measure the impact of post-survey engagement initiatives. </p>\n<p>The bi-monthly pulse surveys will ask the following 6 core engagement questions:\n- The leaders at Mattermost have communicated a vision that motivates me\n- I know how my work contributes to Mattermost's goals\n- I know what I need to do to be successful in my role\n- I am appropriately involved in decisions that affect my work\n- I believe there are good career opportuntities for me at Mattermost\n- I would recommend Mattermost as a great place to work</p>\n<p>Based on the results, the People Team and/or your team leadership will follow up with action items which could include things like <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/hr-cadences#listening-sessions\">listening sessions</a> or <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-cadence#ceo-listening-tours\">listening tours</a> to help us gain a deeper understanding of how individuals and teams are feeling. The initiatives may be org-wide or department specific and the People Team will work closely with managers to action the results. The confidentiality rules and reporting group minimums of Enablement Surveys apply to Pulse Engagement Surveys. Department-level feedback will be shared with the respective Team MLX and Team MLT, and only general themes gleaned from comments will be shared to maintain the confidentiality of respondents. </p>\n<h3>Pulse Survey Dates</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>June 2023</strong> | June 22, 2023 - June 28, 2023</li>\n<li><strong>September 2023</strong> | September 28, 2023 - October 4, 2023</li>\n<li><strong>December 2023</strong> | December 7, 2023 - December 13, 2023</li>\n</ul>",

        "title": "Code of Conduct",
        "content": "# Code of Conduct \n\nMattermost is dedicated to fostering an inclusive workplace, and we prohibit harassment and discrimination of all staff and job applicants regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, veteran status, or other protected categories. We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination and take violations of our policy seriously and will respond appropriately.\n\nMattermost will ensure that all employment actions, including but not limited to recruitment, hiring, selection for training, promotion, transfer, demotion, layoff, recall, termination, rates of pay, or other forms of compensation, will be administered without regard to one\u2019s protected class, including a disability or status as a protected veteran. Mattermost will also provide qualified applicants and employees with disabilities with needed reasonable accommodations, as required by law, and will ensure that all employment decisions are based only on valid job requirements.\n\nAny employee or applicant who believes that they have been subject to harassment because of their protected status should promptly contact a manager in their chain of command, or promptly contact the Director of Human Resources at 650-667-8512 for assistance. Employees or applicants may also file a written complaint with the office of the Director of Human Resources, 530 Lytton Avenue, Second Floor, Palo Alto, 94301.\n\n## Anti-harassment procedures\n\nEmployees and applicants of Mattermost will not be subject to harassment because of any protected status, including disability and protected veteran status.\n\nHarassment is not tolerated. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: verbal language that reinforces social structures of domination related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected categories; sexual imagery in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; offensive verbal language; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.\n\nAny employee or applicant who believes that they have been subject to harassment because of their protected status should promptly contact a manager in their chain of command, or promptly contact the Director of Human Resources at 650-667-8512 for assistance. Employees or applicants may also file a written complaint with the office of the Director of Human Resources, 530 Lytton Avenue, Second Floor, Palo Alto, 94301.\n\nRetaliation, including intimidation, threat, coercion, or discrimination, against an employee or applicant because they have objected to discrimination, engaged or may engage in filing a complaint, assisted in a review, investigation, or hearing or have otherwise sought to obtain their legal rights under any Federal, State, or local EEO law regarding protected veterans is prohibited. Any employee or applicant who believes that they have been subject to retaliation should contact the Director of Human Resources at 650-667-8512 for assistance.\n\n### Anti-harassment training \n\nTraining is provided annually on the identification and prevention of harassment based on disability and protected veteran status to all of Mattermost's employees.\n\n#### Mandatory Manager responsibilities and training\n\nAll Mattermost Managers and Supervisors are responsible for helping to foster an inclusive, safe workplace that is free of harassment and discrimination.\n\nSpecifically, Managers and Supervisors are responsible to: \n\n* Assist in the identification of problem areas, formulate solutions, and establish departmental goals and objectives when necessary.\n* Ensure qualified applicants and employees are treated in a nondiscriminatory manner in all employment practices, including when making selection decisions, such as for hire, promotion, training, or to receive awards or bonuses.\n* Provide reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of qualified individuals with disabilities unless such accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the conduct of its business.\n* Maintain confidentiality of any disability-related or protected veteran status information obtained regarding any applicant or employee; and \n* Ensure that nondiscrimination is adhered to in all personnel activities.\n\nTo enable Managers and Supervisors with these responsibilities, Mattermost provides the following trainings. \n\n**1. Affirmative Action Plan training.** \n  * Purpose: As a Federal Contractor, Mattermost is required to maintain an Affirmative Action Plan. Managers, supervisors, and human resources staff involved in recruiting, screening, selection, promotion, disciplinary, and other related employment processes will receive training regarding Mattermost\u2019s Affirmative Action Plan and their role in its implementation.\n  * Cadence: Annual training\n  \n**2. Harassment prevention training**\n  * Purpose: All staff members in a supervisory role are responsible for helping to foster an inclusive, safe workplace that is free of harassment and discrimination. As part of this, Managers are required to complete a 2-hour Anti-Harassment Training online.\n  * Cadence: Every 2 years\n\nMattermost's Affirmative Action Plan can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15PVfR5uI7TaWuSznLr3hmQd_4aAE-OR3AixVPEO-QF4/edit#heading=h.cbr53qvhhkxh).\n\n## Job abandonment\n\nWhen a staff member is absent from work for 3 consecutive workdays, and there is no entry on the [Who's Out Calendar](http://app.rippling.com/api/feed/calendar/pto/company/are2zz48b0jkynqd/b91837056f386ea9355b4e71f456c24a381efea19840116f0779e81f053199e4/calendar.ics?company=658390ff2cae6bf84a79bcb5), or a post in the [Stand-Up Channel](https://hub.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/stand-up) noting the time off, and the staff member fails to contact their manager or HR, they can be terminated for job abandonment unless otherwise required by local law.\n\nA manager will notify HR if they are unable to reach a direct report within a 24-hour period of the above criteria. HR may then access a staff member's contact information, including emergency contact information, to attempt additional reach out.\n\n### Electronic Monitoring Policy\n\nMattermost does not engage in electronic monitoring of staff or their activities through their work equipment, such as Mattermost-issued laptops or cell phones, work email, Mattermost, or other applications used by the company, except for legal, security, or compliance purposes. Any information collected will be used solely to help Mattermost meet its legal, security, or compliance requirements.\n\nIn the event of a workplace investigation, Mattermost may request access to staff activities on  Mattermost-issued systems or devices, where necessary.\n\n### Health and Safety Policy\n\nCreating a safe workplace is a shared responsibility between Mattermost and all staff. Mattermost is committed to promoting a safe work environment and supporting everyone in ensuring their home work environment is safe, and adheres to legislative requirements for healthy working conditions.\n\nMattermost\u2019s Health & Safety policy outlines the procedures and guidelines for conducting health and safety assessments for all staff. It aims to:\n* Prevent home office environment accidents and work-related ill health.\n* Manage health and safety risks associated with remote work.\n* Provide clear instructions, information, and adequate training on workplace health and safety.\n* Promote health and safety best practices for remote work.\n* Maintain safe and healthy working conditions.\n* Review and revise Mattermost\u2019s health and safety policy regularly.\n\n**Home Office Setup**\n\nAs a remote-first company, staff are responsible for setting up their own home office. Mattermost provides [home office benefits](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/staff-member-expenses/how-to-spend-company-money#home-office-guidelines) and offers general guidelines to ensure that FT Staff have the equipment they need to do their work safely. Anyone requiring accommodations should reach out to the People Team.\n\nWhile we do not prescribe a specific way for staff to set up their work area, the expectation is that everyone maintains a comfortable and safe work environment in a manner that reduces hazards and enhances productivity. This includes the use of ergonomic items such as appropriate desks, chairs, proper lighting, clear walkways, organized electrical cables, and suitable equipment to minimize the risk of workplace injuries. Here\u2019s a [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13-48iC0fKJ17kEgqf798pp7lPGyHq_NzexgcKkSzFgI/edit?usp=sharing) on how to set up an ergonomic home office for maximum productivity and comfort. \n\n**Initial Assessment**\n\nPrior to commencing work at Mattermost, FT staff will be asked to complete an initial health and safety self-assessment. The assessment will help staff to evaluate their home working environment, including workspace ergonomics, lighting, and any potential hazards.\n\n**Health and Safety Responsibilities**\n\nBuilding a safe workplace is a joint responsibility of all staff, managers, and Mattermost. The rights and responsibilities of all parties are outlined below.\n\nStaff have the right to:\n* Know about workplace health and safety hazards.\n* Participate in making recommendations about workplace health and safety. \n* Refuse work they believe is unsafe.\n\nStaff Responsibilities:\n* Abide by workplace health and safety policies and procedures.\n* Take safety precautions at all times.\n* Take reasonable care of their health and safety.\n* Promptly report any health and safety concerns to their managers or the Joint Health and Safety Committee (JHSC).\n* Be familiar with safety measures in their homes.\n* Ensure that electrical equipment and appliances used for work, such as computers, monitors, and chargers, are in safe working condition.\n* Have access to a first aid kit in their home working environment and be aware of the contents of the kit and how to use them appropriately in case of minor injuries.\n\nManager Responsibilities:\n* Take all health and safety concerns of staff seriously and report them to the People team.\n* Lead by example of how to work safely, ensuring they follow the law.\n* Take all reasonable measures to protect team members by not assigning unsafe tasks.\n\nCompany Responsibilities:\n* Create and implement a health and safety policy.\n* Ensure that staff are aware of potential remote workplace health and safety hazards by providing information, instructions, and training where required.\n\n**Joint Health and Safety Committee (JHSC)**\n\nThe JHSC's role is to raise awareness of health and safety issues in the workplace, identify health and safety risks, and make recommendations on areas for improving safety where necessary. The committee will hold regular meetings and initiate the quarterly workplace inspections conducted by staff members of their home office.\n\n**Periodic Workplace Inspections** \n\nWorkplace inspections are an important component of Mattermost\u2019s Health and Safety Policy, aimed at identifying, evaluating, and mitigating potential health and safety hazards.\n\nStaff are asked to inspect their workplaces quarterly using the Workplace Health and Safety Checklist, posted in the Workplace Health and Safety channel in Mattermost. The results of the inspection will help the JHSC evaluate potential risks, implement control measures, and develop appropriate training and resources to equip staff with the knowledge and skills to address potential risks.\n\nAll staff will be equally responsible for minimizing accidents within their workspaces. These responsibilities include but are not limited to working in compliance with local Health and Safety regulations, operating in compliance with Mattermost\u2019s safe work policies and procedures, and using or following the measures put in place to maintain a healthy work environment.\n\n**Training and Communication**\n\nMattermost will provide adequate health and safety training to staff where required including information about potential risks, and safe practices. Communications and updates about relevant health and safety topics, training, policies, procedures, and best practices will be shared in the Workplace Health and Safety channel in Mattermost.\n\n**Reporting and Incident Management**\n\nStaff must promptly report any health and safety incident to their managers, the People team, or the Joint Health and Safety Committee (JHSC).

Any employee or applicant who believes that they have been subject to retaliation should contact the Director of Human Resources at 650-667-8512 for assistance.</p>\n<h3>Anti-harassment training</h3>\n<p>Training is provided annually on the identification and prevention of harassment based on disability and protected veteran status to all of Mattermost's employees.</p>\n<h4>Mandatory Manager responsibilities and training</h4>\n<p>All Mattermost Managers and Supervisors are responsible for helping to foster an inclusive, safe workplace that is free of harassment and discrimination.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Managers and Supervisors are responsible to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assist in the identification of problem areas, formulate solutions, and establish departmental goals and objectives when necessary.</li>\n<li>Ensure qualified applicants and employees are treated in a nondiscriminatory manner in all employment practices, including when making selection decisions, such as for hire, promotion, training, or to receive awards or bonuses.</li>\n<li>Provide reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of qualified individuals with disabilities unless such accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the conduct of its business.</li>\n<li>Maintain confidentiality of any disability-related or protected veteran status information obtained regarding any applicant or employee; and </li>\n<li>Ensure that nondiscrimination is adhered to in all personnel activities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To enable Managers and Supervisors with these responsibilities, Mattermost provides the following trainings. </p>\n<p><strong>1. Affirmative Action Plan training.</strong> \n  * Purpose: As a Federal Contractor, Mattermost is required to maintain an Affirmative Action Plan. Managers, supervisors, and human resources staff involved in recruiting, screening, selection, promotion, disciplinary, and other related employment processes will receive training regarding Mattermost\u2019s Affirmative Action Plan and their role in its implementation.\n  * Cadence: Annual training</p>\n<p><strong>2. Harassment prevention training</strong>\n  * Purpose: All staff members in a supervisory role are responsible for helping to foster an inclusive, safe workplace that is free of harassment and discrimination. As part of this, Managers are required to complete a 2-hour Anti-Harassment Training online.\n  * Cadence: Every 2 years</p>\n<p>Mattermost's Affirmative Action Plan can be found <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15PVfR5uI7TaWuSznLr3hmQd_4aAE-OR3AixVPEO-QF4/edit#heading=h.cbr53qvhhkxh\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Job abandonment</h2>\n<p>When a staff member is absent from work for 3 consecutive workdays, and there is no entry on the <a href=\"http://app.rippling.com/api/feed/calendar/pto/company/are2zz48b0jkynqd/b91837056f386ea9355b4e71f456c24a381efea19840116f0779e81f053199e4/calendar.ics?company=658390ff2cae6bf84a79bcb5\">Who's Out Calendar</a>, or a post in the <a href=\"https://hub.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/stand-up\">Stand-Up Channel</a> noting the time off, and the staff member fails to contact their manager or HR, they can be terminated for job abandonment unless otherwise required by local law.</p>\n<p>A manager will notify HR if they are unable to reach a direct report within a 24-hour period of the above criteria. HR may then access a staff member's contact information, including emergency contact information, to attempt additional reach out.</p>\n<h3>Electronic Monitoring Policy</h3>\n<p>Mattermost does not engage in electronic monitoring of staff or their activities through their work equipment, such as Mattermost-issued laptops or cell phones, work email, Mattermost, or other applications used by the company, except for legal, security, or compliance purposes. Any information collected will be used solely to help Mattermost meet its legal, security, or compliance requirements.</p>\n<p>In the event of a workplace investigation, Mattermost may request access to staff activities on  Mattermost-issued systems or devices, where necessary.</p>\n<h3>Health and Safety Policy</h3>\n<p>Creating a safe workplace is a shared responsibility between Mattermost and all staff. Mattermost is committed to promoting a safe work environment and supporting everyone in ensuring their home work environment is safe, and adheres to legislative requirements for healthy working conditions.</p>\n<p>Mattermost\u2019s Health &amp; Safety policy outlines the procedures and guidelines for conducting health and safety assessments for all staff. It aims to:\n* Prevent home office environment accidents and work-related ill health.\n* Manage health and safety risks associated with remote work.\n* Provide clear instructions, information, and adequate training on workplace health and safety.\n* Promote health and safety best practices for remote work.\n* Maintain safe and healthy working conditions.\n* Review and revise Mattermost\u2019s health and safety policy regularly.</p>\n<p><strong>Home Office Setup</strong></p>\n<p>As a remote-first company, staff are responsible for setting up their own home office. Mattermost provides <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/staff-member-expenses/how-to-spend-company-money#home-office-guidelines\">home office benefits</a> and offers general guidelines to ensure that FT Staff have the equipment they need to do their work safely. Anyone requiring accommodations should reach out to the People Team.</p>\n<p>While we do not prescribe a specific way for staff to set up their work area, the expectation is that everyone maintains a comfortable and safe work environment in a manner that reduces hazards and enhances productivity. This includes the use of ergonomic items such as appropriate desks, chairs, proper lighting, clear walkways, organized electrical cables, and suitable equipment to minimize the risk of workplace injuries. Here\u2019s a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/13-48iC0fKJ17kEgqf798pp7lPGyHq_NzexgcKkSzFgI/edit?usp=sharing\">guide</a> on how to set up an ergonomic home office for maximum productivity and comfort. </p>\n<p><strong>Initial Assessment</strong></p>\n<p>Prior to commencing work at Mattermost, FT staff will be asked to complete an initial health and safety self-assessment. The assessment will help staff to evaluate their home working environment, including workspace ergonomics, lighting, and any potential hazards.</p>\n<p><strong>Health and Safety Responsibilities</strong></p>\n<p>Building a safe workplace is a joint responsibility of all staff, managers, and Mattermost. The rights and responsibilities of all parties are outlined below.</p>\n<p>Staff have the right to:\n* Know about workplace health and safety hazards.\n* Participate in making recommendations about workplace health and safety. \n* Refuse work they believe is unsafe.</p>\n<p>Staff Responsibilities:\n* Abide by workplace health and safety policies and procedures.\n* Take safety precautions at all times.\n* Take reasonable care of their health and safety.\n* Promptly report any health and safety concerns to their managers or the Joint Health and Safety Committee (JHSC).\n* Be familiar with safety measures in their homes.\n* Ensure that electrical equipment and appliances used for work, such as computers, monitors, and chargers, are in safe working condition.\n* Have access to a first aid kit in their home working environment and be aware of the contents of the kit and how to use them appropriately in case of minor injuries.</p>\n<p>Manager Responsibilities:\n* Take all health and safety concerns of staff seriously and report them to the People team.\n* Lead by example of how to work safely, ensuring they follow the law.\n* Take all reasonable measures to protect team members by not assigning unsafe tasks.</p>\n<p>Company Responsibilities:\n* Create and implement a health and safety policy.\n* Ensure that staff are aware of potential remote workplace health and safety hazards by providing information, instructions, and training where required.</p>\n<p><strong>Joint Health and Safety Committee (JHSC)</strong></p>\n<p>The JHSC's role is to raise awareness of health and safety issues in the workplace, identify health and safety risks, and make recommendations on areas for improving safety where necessary.

        "content": "---\ndescription: How to do performance reviews the Mattermost way.\n---\n\n# Performance Reviews\n\nThe performance review process is a vital practice to reflect on the output of ourselves and our colleagues, to identify the key opportunities for each of us to grow and excel, to objectively review our capabilities and track record on delivering results against the requirements of our role levels, which may result in level-based promotions, compensation adjustments, and/or changes in role.\n\n## Why are performance reviews important?\n\nThe responsibility of a manager is to increase the total output of the organizations they control and the organizations they influence.\n\nThe primary purpose of a performance review is to assess a colleague's performance, have the colleague clearly understand how to progress professionally in the opinion of the manager, and hold the colleague accountable for increasing their performance based on the assessment and feedback.\n\nIt's one of the most difficult things a people manager needs to do - it's also one of the most important.\n\n### Other than increasing output, what are other objectives of performance reviews?\n\nIn addition to the primary goal increasing the output of colleagues and of the organization, the performance review process also serves to align our actions to the [Mattermost Leadership Principles](../../../../company/about-mattermost/#leadership-principles). These are used as the criteria for peer-evaluation, and to calibrate role levels with colleagues', which may result in level-based promotions and compensation adjustments or, if level expectations are repeatedly not met, changes in role.\n\n## Manager Training\n\nWe believe a Manager\u2019s fundamental role in a performance review is to improve performance. We use Chapter 13 of the book [High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove-ebook/dp/B015VACHOK) as the framework and pre-reading for our review process.\n\nAt performance review time all managers should:\n\n1. Complete reading this document on performance reviews and related documents on relevant departmental review process in detail.\n2. Read or re-read Chapter 13 of [High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove-ebook/dp/B015VACHOK). If you don't have a copy of the book, you can complete the [High Output Management Book Order form](https://forms.gle/J2Aio3Lv1eK74ob3A) and Workplace will order a copy for you, or you can order and expense the cost.\n3. [Complete a short set of questions](https://forms.gle/uG8VvFGcpSfQMdvz6) to reflect on the material.\n4. If you have not yet been through a Performance Review Training session organized by HR in the last 18 months, please join one when requested as the review cycle begins.\n\n## How is feedback shared?\n\nFeedback is solicited in a 360-degree style to incorporate feedback from peers. If you manage people, your manager may include direct reports in your peer feedback panel.\n\n### Peer Feedback\n\nStaff are welcome to select 3-5 peers for their peer feedback panel. Managers can adjust the panel at any time. Peer reviews include [Likes and Wishes](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#likes-and-wishes).\n\nNote: HR will try and limit peer review panel requests to a maximum of 5 per person.\n\n### Self Reflection\n\n[Self Awareness](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles) is one of our [Leadership Principles](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles) and will be a factor of success for the entire process. The self reflection includes all of the review categories in the peer review.\n\n### Manager Evaluation\n\nManagers will review all feedback to complete your performance appraisal. In addition to providing feedback based on your performance, Managers will provide an overall performance rating. \n\n* **Performance rating** is a manager's rating based on a direct report's execution of [AORs](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/areas-of-responsibility) and other responsibilities for the review period.\n\n## What is the process?\n\nAll staff take part in the Annual End of Year Performance Review Cycle and the Mid-Year Performance Review Cycle. The intent of the mid-year review cycle is to promote timely performance feedback. Compensation is only reviewed during the annual Winter Performance Review cycle.\n\n* Mid-Year Review\n* [EOY Review Process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people/performance-reviews-50/formal-review-process)\n\nTeam members joining in April will not need to do the [90 day New Colleague review](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding#new-colleague-90-day-feedback-process) and will instead take part in the Mid-Year Performance Review Cycle. Team members joining May - August will follow the typical [90 day New Colleague review process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding#new-colleague-90-day-feedback-process) and are not required to complete the Mid-Year Review.\n\nTeam members joining in August and September will not need to do the [90 day New Colleague review](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding#new-colleague-90-day-feedback-process) and will instead take part in review cycle. Team members joining October - December will follow the typical [90 day New Colleague review process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding#new-colleague-90-day-feedback-process) and are not required to complete the End of Year Review.\n\n### Rating Scale\n\nBehaviorally-anchored performance ratings help us to establish a shared and agreed-upon language that describes well-defined performance expectations, desired behaviours, and outcomes. Rating scales can also check biases and enhance distributive and procedural fairness during performance calibrations.\n\nWe have had several iterations of the rating scale as we continue to respond to staff feedback. For the EOY 2021 review cycle, we moved to a 4-point rating scale to ensure clarity and differentiation between ratings. Based on feedback, we have also adjusted the rating scale to have 1 clear rating of \"not meeting expectations\" and 3 options describing average to above-average performance. \n\n1. **Needs development:** Does not consistently meet expectations that are appropriate for the role or level. Additional direction and support are needed. Willing or able to improve but lacks results required for the role. \n2. **Consistently meets expectations:** Regularly meets and sometimes exceeds expectations. May require some direction to achieve core responsibilities for the role or team goals. Seen as a consistent and dependable teammate. \n3. **Often exceeds expectations:** Regularly exceeds expectations. Requires little to no direction to achieve the core responsibilities of the role and often identifies solutions that have a greater impact on team goals.\n4. **Consistently exceeds expectations:** Exceptional performance. Strongly exceeds expectations and consistently delivers beyond the goals of the role. Enables others to perform better. \n\n### Questions and Answers\n\n#### Are annual performance reviews also a time to review compensation?\n\nYes. In the process of reviewing performance against target levels, changes in level and in compensation are also reviewed with the HR team and compensation committees by department.\n\n#### Are there any resources available?\n\n* Learn how to use Lattice, nominate peer reviewers, give effective peer and upward feedback, and write your self-reflection by reviewing Lattice's [Getting Started Guide for Employees](https://help.lattice.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000458042-Getting-Started-Guide-for-Employees).\n* People Managers should review Lattice's [Getting Started Guide for Managers](https://help.lattice.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058934294-Getting-Started-Guide-for-Managers) to learn how to use the platform as a people manager.

To complete the request, click **give feedback**. You may decline the request if you don't have feedback to share; however, staff are encouraged to provide feedback when selected as a peer reviewer. Peer reviews help give managers a fuller picture by removing potential blindspots on how their direct reports are performing as it relates to their AORs, goals and growth opportunities, which ultimately helps your peers improve performance and growth potential at Mattermost.  \n\n## Self reflection\n\nFull-time staff will receive an email via Lattice to complete their self-assessment. To get started, log in to Lattice and navigate to your home page where you'll find a request to complete your self-reflection. Once your self-reflection has been submitted, managers are able to make comments directly in your self-reflection document. Prior to writing their self-reflections, full-time staff should review Lattice's guide on completing performance reviews [here](https://help.lattice.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060207674-Complete-a-Performance-Review).\n\n## Performance Review\n\nOnce self-reviews and peer feedback have been completed, Managers will receive a notification from Lattice inviting them to write the performance reviews. Managers will read all feedback from the peer panel and self-assessment, and will incorporate their feedback based on their own performance expectations of this role.\n\nWhen the review is complete, Managers will not share the reviews with their reports until calibration has been completed and any changes have been approved. HR will turn on \"sharing\" after all results have been finalized. Managers will then share the reviews with their direct reports accordingly. _Note: It's helpful to share the review ahead of the 1:1 meeting to allow for time to read and digest feedback._\n\n## Calibration\n\nAll people Managers within the same [department](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#departments) or other group that the Team [MLT](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/mlt-cadence) indicates will participate in calibrations.\n\nManagers will share their review expectation ratings \\(meets, exceeds, does not meet\\), any recommendations for a [level](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XNGYOHouoY42YYmFHNrhu-vHDtWVrPL5E8M_BpwF9iU/edit) change and/or a promotion, in the performance review for each of their reports. This recommendation is not shared with reports. HR will prepare calibration reports for each department/team and will share the report with the calibration group ahead of the meeting. During the meeting, Managers share feedback on any performance metric and apply [high standards](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles) in evaluation against the criteria for staff members' role and level.\n\n## Compensation review and change memos\n\nAll compensation changes require approval of the CFO and the CEO.\n\n1. HR will review compensation data with each Team MLT 1:1, asynchronously.\n2. HR, Team MLT, and required comp approvers meet to discuss, with email approval to follow and finalize with all attendees CC'd.\n3. HR will send compensation change memos to each individual upon confirmation that the compensation news has been shared.\n\n## Review discussion\n\nUsing your direct report's peer feedback and self assessment, deliver feedback with tangible and thoughtful feedback. This includes: accompolishments, areas of strength and opportunity for growth, and your evaluation of how your direct performance either meets, exceeds, or does not meet your expectations. If performance does not meet your expectations there will be a plan to improve performance, this may be informal or formal.\n\n",

We strive to provide opportunities for individual growth and career development by encouraging continuous learning and knowledge sharing.\n\n## Guiding principles\n\n1. **Inclusively enable:** People learn differently and in the context of learning enabling performance, we strive to design learning experiences and programs to support our global workforce.\n2. **Cultural reinforcement:** Learning and Development programs should reinforce our Leadership Principles: Customer Obsession, Ownership, High Impact, Earn Trust, Self Awareness.\n3. **Develop mastery:** Make the learnings impactful by choosing training that you\u2019ll be able to practice at work. [The Forgetting Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve) shows how learned information slips out of memory unless action and care is taken to retain it. [The Learning Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_pyramid) shows that 90% of learned material is retained when you teach it to someone else. In other words, [Learn, Master, Teach](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#learn-master-teach).\n\n## Learning programs \n\n**Manager 01** is a toolkit developed by the People Team to onboard new managers and equip them with the fundamental knowledge and resources they\u2019ll need to be successful People Managers at Mattermost. The toolkit is designed to help new managers understand expectations including behaviors, shared values, programs, and processes. The toolkit is a living document and will continue to evolve over time. Managers are encouraged to share feedback and contribute to the learning and development of their peers.\n\n**The Manager Core Skills Training Series** is developed by LifeLabs Learning and based on extensive research in psychology and organizational behavior. The training consists of 10 workshops and is designed to equip managers with the core skills and knowledge key to effective and inclusive leadership. \n- We offer LifeLabs Learning workshops to our Individual Contributors (ICs) to enhance important skills and competencies that complement the Manager Core Skills Training Series.\n- Culture Amp\u2019s Skills Coach delivers bite-size, daily, interactive online learnings that are based on LifeLabs\u2019 Core Skills material. Managers and ICs can self-enroll in the micro-workshops directly in Culture Amp.\n\n**GrowthSpace** Coaching is an impactful way for individuals to boost their performance and drive their growth and development. We\u2019ve partnered with Growth Space to offer full-time staff an opportunity to engage with industry experts through a tailored coaching program. Participants will be matched with an experienced coach over five one-hour long sessions to develop, improve, or enhance key skills identified as targeted areas for growth. The focus areas will align with specific development goals participants set in combination with their manager.\n\n## GrowthSpace\n\nLearning is a core part of our culture and we strive to emphasize deliberate development by creating different learning opportunities and experiences that help support our global, remote team. As a GrowthSpace participant, you will be matched with an experienced coach to develop, improve, and enhance key skills identified as targeted areas for growth that align with specific development goals that you've set with your manager.\n\n1. **Participants:** All full-time staff are eligible to participate in the GrowthSpace program. While managers may nominate a direct report to participate, full-time staff are also encouraged to self-nominate.\n\nCoaching requires an investment of time and energy. As a general guideline, it\u2019s a benefit that's ideal for individuals who are self-aware, are open to change and feedback, and:\n\n- Are a new or emerging leader, or have a desire to move into a leadership role; or\n- Have recently changed roles, or have recently been promoted; or\n- Have experienced significant organizational change and their success is critical to the success of the team or department; or\n- Have identified development goals they'd like to achieve in the short term (6 months - 1 year) and will benefit from additional coaching to enhance specific strengths to be more effective.\n\n*Given the limited number of spaces available, please discuss the opportunity with your manager to determine if this is the right opportunity for you before submitting your self-nomination. Reach out to hr@mattermost.com with any questions. Priority will be given to applicants that meet the criteria above.*\n\n2. **Process:** If you're interested in participating in the GrowthSpace coaching program, consider the growth opportunities from your most recent performance or development conversation. Meet with your manager to align on one to two specific development goals and a GrowthSpace focus area. Once you\u2019re both happy and aligned on the plan, complete the [GrowthSpace Self-Reflection Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe8w-V5m3oj6wd3-aMCOk5bSNpMVT9_J6476ghUH5EwgsxqBA/viewform?usp=sf_link). Next, you'll receive an online GrowthSpace onboarding form to fill out in order to be matched with an expert according to your role and your [targeted area for growth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xWxvOBjB6YuxvRX_tJJTP7TO8RsCNhKL/view?usp=sharing).\n\nOnce matched, you'll receive an email from GrowthSpace including your coach\u2019s details and an invitation to schedule your first session. The program consists of five one-hour long coaching sessions. We recommend spacing each session 1-2 weeks apart so you have a chance to reflect on your sessions and actively practice on the job to reinforce your learnings. If you feel that the match isn\u2019t right for you, you can change your coach after the first session. *All GrowthSpace coaches sign a confidentiality agreement to protect your privacy.* Throughout the program, review and update your progress with your manager during your regular 1:1s to ensure you\u2019re on track.\n\n3. **Feedback:** GrowthSpace will prompt participants to fill out a feedback survey after the third and final sessions to assess program effectiveness.

The toolkit is a living document and will continue to evolve over time. Managers are encouraged to share feedback and contribute to the learning and development of their peers.</p>\n<p><strong>The Manager Core Skills Training Series</strong> is developed by LifeLabs Learning and based on extensive research in psychology and organizational behavior.

        "content": "---\ndescription: A Guide to Time Off\n---\n\n# Planned Time Off\n\nMattermost is a high-performance, fast-paced startup where staff are empowered to do the best work of their careers. We love what we do and we love doing it from anywhere, working remotely and often blending our work and personal lives.\n\nIn many ways, Mattermost can be \"the Olympics\" of our professional careers, with the opportunity to grow and achieve far beyond anywhere we've worked before. At the same time, like star athletes, our growth and peak performance benefit greatly from the ability to interleave periods of exertion with periods of rest and reflection.\n\nPlanned Time Off \\(\"[PTO](../../../../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#pto-or-paid-time-off)\"\\) is a process to help ensure our staff develop a strong practice of **self-care** by effectively rotating their time around work, family, friends and all the things that matter most to them. Mattermost is committed to supporting the well-being and work-life balance of our staff through our Unlimited PTO policy. This policy allows our team members the flexibility to take time off as needed, encouraging rest and making sure everyone is bringing their best selves to work.\n\nNote: If you are taking [Pregnancy](../leaves-of-absence/pregnancy-leave.md) or [Parental Leave](../leaves-of-absence/pregnancy-leave.md), please see [Leave Policies](../leaves-of-absence/).\n\n## Statutory Vacation Requirements\nThere may be statutory vacation entitlements in countries where Mattermost has an entity or EOR. At a minimum, staff must use their statutory vacation entitlement each year and it is the responsibility of managers to ensure that their direct reports are taking the required statutory minimum vacation. We understand there may be circumstances where, due to exceptional operational needs or personal issues, it isn\u2019t possible to use up the full annual statutory vacation entitlement.  Exceptions may be granted for vacation carry over in those situations or where there is a statutory requirement to do so. Statutory vacation day carryover must be approved in advance by your manager, Team MLT, and the People Team. Staff members should work with their managers to discuss a plan for booking any accrued but unused statutory vacation. \n\nYou can find the list of the different statutory vacation requirements for each entity and EOR location [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cpW7KRsaS6n2nm_5oTwb_9s1JDKiD2AyuDJKOek48FA/edit).\n\n## Communicating time off\n\n### When you take time off \\(full days only\\) please do the following\n\n1. Communicate your Planned Time Off (PTO) by booking time off in **Rippling > Time Off > Schedule Time Off**. You can also watch this [short video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AmDFbIHGsBTPKg-TTTVlO6gAxSuLDFv0/view?usp=drive_link) on how to book time off in Rippling. PTO covers any number of things - including vacations, stay-cations, moving days, etc. When submitting vacation requests in Rippling, select \"Planned Time Off\". PTO is in addition to official public holidays in your region of residence. In some countries where there are statutory vacation requirements, public holidays are a supplementary entitlement.\n2. For audit and compliance purposes, Time Off for EOR staff will also be recorded in Deel by the People team.\n3. Statutory public holidays for FT Staff in entity and EOR locations (Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, Sweden, US, UK) are automatically listed in Rippling. *For all FT Staff outside of entity and EOR locations, please ensure to enter any statutory public holidays taken in your region of residence in Rippling > Time Off > Public Holiday to distinguish it from PTO.* \n4. If time off is being taken for sickness, including physical and mental needs, please enter these days in **Rippling > Time Off > Sick, to distinguish from other types of PTO. Follow the appropriate process according to the statutory requirements in your region of residence. If taking extended time off for medical leave or for other types of [leaves](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/leaves-of-absence), reach out to HR: hr@mattermost.com.\n5. PTO requests must be \"approved\" in Rippling to show up in the \"Who's Out\" calendar.  \n6. Managers are responsible for approving their direct reports' time off requests in Rippling before they proceed on time off.\n7. Be [vacation-ready](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms#vacation-ready): \n\n    * Assign PTO backups and [list your PTO Backups in GSuite Vacation Responder](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yu4pNey7BSjSG7eqEb6K4NDpmudOvGD7vbcdFyZegDg/edit?usp=sharing)\n    * Rippling will automatically set your GCal status to OOO. Make sure to auto-decline new and existing meetings while you're away\n    * [Change your Mattermost status](https://docs.mattermost.com/welcome/set-your-status-availability.html)\n    * [Set automatic direct message replies in Mattermost](https://docs.mattermost.com/channels/channels-settings.html#automatic-direct-message-replies).\n    * Watch [this vacation-ready video from Ian Tien](https://community.mattermost.com/files/bd1x8f47abgdx83ejpesd1z7ce/public?h=EWRJ-lMoUotKhiPyPAJzS_6Zt2uyAmaJh08xHr8LIBU), CEO of Mattermost.\n    * Enjoy your time off!\n\n### Where to go to see who's out\n\n* [Stand-up channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/stand-up)\n* Rippling homepage via the \u2018Feed\u2019 menu on your dashboard. Here, you will find information regarding who is out of office and who has upcoming time off scheduled.\n* Rippling Who's Out Calendar. You can create an [iCalendar Feed](http://app.rippling.com/api/feed/calendar/pto/company/are2zz48b0jkynqd/b91837056f386ea9355b4e71f456c24a381efea19840116f0779e81f053199e4/calendar.ics) to link the Who's Out Calendar to your GCalendar. To configure this, go to your Calendar > Add other calendars > Select from URL option > Paste the calendar link and you're done!\n\n### Common time off questions\n\n1. **Is there really no limit?** There is no limit to how much time off you can take when your work is meeting or exceeding expectations. We strongly recommend a minimum of 2 weeks per year.\n2. **Is PTO monitored?** PTO is not monitored, but we encourage managers to ensure their direct reports are taking at least the recommended minimum of 2 weeks off per year (and/or the statutory minimum in their region of residence).

We love what we do and we love doing it from anywhere, working remotely and often blending our work and personal lives.</p>\n<p>In many ways, Mattermost can be \"the Olympics\" of our professional careers, with the opportunity to grow and achieve far beyond anywhere we've worked before. At the same time, like star athletes, our growth and peak performance benefit greatly from the ability to interleave periods of exertion with periods of rest and reflection.</p>\n<p>Planned Time Off (\"<a href=\"../../../../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#pto-or-paid-time-off\">PTO</a>\") is a process to help ensure our staff develop a strong practice of <strong>self-care</strong> by effectively rotating their time around work, family, friends and all the things that matter most to them. Mattermost is committed to supporting the well-being and work-life balance of our staff through our Unlimited PTO policy. This policy allows our team members the flexibility to take time off as needed, encouraging rest and making sure everyone is bringing their best selves to work.</p>\n<p>Note: If you are taking <a href=\"../leaves-of-absence/pregnancy-leave.md\">Pregnancy</a> or <a href=\"../leaves-of-absence/pregnancy-leave.md\">Parental Leave</a>, please see <a href=\"../leaves-of-absence/\">Leave Policies</a>.</p>\n<h2>Statutory Vacation Requirements</h2>\n<p>There may be statutory vacation entitlements in countries where Mattermost has an entity or EOR. At a minimum, staff must use their statutory vacation entitlement each year and it is the responsibility of managers to ensure that their direct reports are taking the required statutory minimum vacation. We understand there may be circumstances where, due to exceptional operational needs or personal issues, it isn\u2019t possible to use up the full annual statutory vacation entitlement.  Exceptions may be granted for vacation carry over in those situations or where there is a statutory requirement to do so. Statutory vacation day carryover must be approved in advance by your manager, Team MLT, and the People Team. Staff members should work with their managers to discuss a plan for booking any accrued but unused statutory vacation. </p>\n<p>You can find the list of the different statutory vacation requirements for each entity and EOR location <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cpW7KRsaS6n2nm_5oTwb_9s1JDKiD2AyuDJKOek48FA/edit\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Communicating time off</h2>\n<h3>When you take time off (full days only) please do the following</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Communicate your Planned Time Off (PTO) by booking time off in <strong>Rippling &gt; Time Off &gt; Schedule Time Off</strong>.

In-person meetups are an opportunity to build on those relationships. All in-person travel requires a Meetup Champion, also called Travel DRIs. This person will partner with the Workplace Community Manager on planning and logistics, and will also be responsible for obtaining appropriate approvals and ensuring applicable travel guidelines are followed.\n\n**Process for getting started**\n\n1. Obtain written approval to plan an in-person meetup from your team MLT.\n2. Make a copy of this [meetup template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZD6BchqUMPC0quYkU_vnT95vENxMSGZ3DRWQi7jxWhQ/edit#gid=626981306) and complete as much as you can. Share your meetup template and the written approval with the Workplace Community Manager (WPCM).\n\n## Staff travel guidelines during COVID\n\nMattermost is not requiring any team members to travel during COVID. Although there may be some in-person travel planned for teams, departments, conferences, or meet-ups, no team member will be required to attend. We understand that folks may feel safer to travel depending on the current COVID data for the region they reside and plan to travel to, but we also understand that factors can change very quickly. We've created the following guidelines for anyone looking into or participating in any sort of in-person travel.\n\n1. **100% optional event.** Attendance is not required for in-person meetings or events. Attending meetings or events in-person is at your own discretion and risk. Travelers should note:\n    * You may need a proof of COVID-19 vaccine and/or PCR test at departure/arrival at some airports, it is each traveler\u2019s responsibility to research, understand and abide by these requirements.\n    * Travelers are responsible for knowing any travel visa requirements of your destination region(s) and region of origin. Please see more info here: Handbook > business travel.\n2. **Plan inclusively.** We understand that not all team members will be able, or feel safe, to travel, and we ask that trip planners be mindful of your team, department, and colleagues when requesting a trip. This can include having an open conversation with the team members ahead of planning the trip. Staff are welcome to reach out to your People Partner or the Workplace Community Manager for help/tips on how to open these conversations.\n    * Plan inclusive events with team members that do not attend, examples of this include, but aren\u2019t limited to: access to meetings, conversations, notes, decisions. See: Dev Handbook > Meeting Etiquette for additional tips.\n    * Team members can include a direct team, a guild, or a department but should make clear that there is no obligation nor requirement to attend any meetings or events in person.\n3. **Follow mandated travel guidelines.** Travelers are responsible for, and required to abide by, the guidelines enforced in all locations to which they are traveling, this includes flight stopovers and the duration of the event. Additionally, travelers should refer to [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html), [recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/map-and-travel-notices.html), and any local equivalent to ensure it\u2019s safe to travel to/from the home country/region and destination. If you're unsure, please reach out to your manager or workplace to help blindspot check.\n4. **Book refundable fare and lodging.** In the event that COVID travel requirements change in the departure or arrival regions, select refundable rates whenever possible.\n    * For conferences or solo-type trips, Mattermost will not sponsor any lodging expenses due to quarantine requirements, unless there's a unique situation where this quarantine was unavoidable. Note: This trip is optional and not a work requirement, and similar to other trips like MatterCon, we won't cover any expenses outside of what the regional meetups state. We do have travel insurance, and staff are encouraged to review the AIG FAQ to understand coverage, guidelines and requirements.\n    * Our preferred airline vendor is United Airlines and we have an account you can use. For info on booking travel, see Handbook: staff member expenses > airfare and traveling.\n    * If you need help booking your travels, please use [this form](https://forms.gle/CEMNgK4GHuAWAiqX6).\n5. **Travel Approval.** Travel Champions will need approval by their Team MLT member and the Workplace Community Manager (WPCM) prior to booking. Travel approval requests should include: trip dates, purpose, and budget/cost.\n    * Please use [this meetups template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZD6BchqUMPC0quYkU_vnT95vENxMSGZ3DRWQi7jxWhQ/edit?usp=sharing) and share with the WPCM for review and approval.\n    * **Travel champions are responsible for all travel planning.** See above template for more information. If you need help please reach out to the WPCM.\n    * Meetup requests that are longer than one day must be submitted two months in advance.\n    * Meetup requests for a one day meetup must be submitted two weeks in advance.\n6. **Mask etiquette.** In addition to following the guidelines of the venues and country/region, the team should plan to follow the [CDC Guidelines for face coverings](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html).\n7. **COVID-19 travel working group.** This group will consist of: Hanna Park, Natalie Jew, Zef Hemel, who will meet on a monthly basis to assess any changes that may need to be made to the guidelines. Changes will be shared with MLT and MLX prior to finalization and internal messaging.\n\n**Upcoming Meetings**\n\n* June 3, 2022\n* July 8, 2022\n* August 5, 2022\n* September 2, 2022\n* October 7, 2022\n",

To make that happen we first have to create a great place to work\u2013an inclusive, courteous online community where incredibly talented individuals are empowered to do their best work for our customers, with very little in their way. This guide is a summary of our guiding principles. As Mattermost grows, we hope these principles serve each new staff person that joins us. If you're new to Mattermost, welcome! While the goals here are important, it\u2019s your ideas, talent, and energy that will keep Mattermost shining in the years ahead. Thanks for being here. Let\u2019s change the world.\n\n### [How to use our Handbook](https://handbook.mattermost.com/)\n\nOur handbook defines what it\u2019s like to work at Mattermost, from the high level to specific operating procedures. If you\u2019re new, you\u2019ll start with our onboarding guides.\n\n### [Our Mission](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#mission)\n\nOur mission is to make the world safer and more productive by developing and delivering secure, open source collaboration software that is trusted, flexible and offers fast time-to-value.\n\n### [Leadership Principles](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles)\n\nLeadership principles are deliberate choices defining our behavior. When facing complexity, uncertainty, or ambiguity \\(CUA\\) we determine our point of view and our actions through the lens of our values:\n\n* **Customer Obsession:** We exist to make customers successful. In everything we do, start with customer perspective and work backwards. Earn and keep their trust.\n* **Ownership:** Own the outcomes of your activity. Don\u2019t drop the ball. When we see a vacuum on something important, we jump in \u2013 we never say \u201cit\u2019s not my job.\u201d\n* **High-Impact:** Align work to our shared vision and focus on those priorities. When deciding to work on low impact or high impact projects, choose high impact.\n* **Self-Awareness:** We understand and seek to understand our strengths and growth opportunities, as individuals and organizations. We are open to critique and share critique constructively and respectfully.\n* **Earn Trust:** Make decisions based on maximizing the trust of others in your judgement. Be open, self-critical, and factual. Earn and keep peoples' trust.\n\nTo view video of these Leadership Principles, please click [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cuxqePfpj2zy4DYLQ__DPtq2uJdGfwaL).\n\n### [Products](https://docs.mattermost.com/overview/product.html)\n\nMattermost Team Edition under MIT license and the Mattermost open source projects under various licenses are maintained by core committers, including both staff from Mattermost, Inc. and volunteer contributors from the Mattermost user and customer communities.\n\nMattermost Enterprise Editions, which are commercial extensions built on top of the Mattermost open source projects, are developed, supported and sold by Mattermost, Inc.\n\nFor more information, see our [Product Overview](https://docs.mattermost.com/overview/product.html).\n\n### [Company](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/business-model)\n\nMattermost is an open source, remote-first, communities-centered company based in Palo Alto, California and headquartered on the internet.\n\n**Open source** means that by default we make our technology, business process and source code available to the public. We develop a small portion as proprietary technology, built upon our open source work, to license for subscription fees that enable more high quality open source work to be produced. Since the start of the Mattermost open source project in 2015, we have used this model to develop effective open source solutions for the world to use. This model is sometimes called [Thin Open Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model).\n\n**Remote-first** means that by default our staff works anywhere in the world where a\\) we have support for quality video calling and b\\) where we can work in a legally appropriate environment. Mattermost was born in an extraordinary age where organizations can attract, hire, and enable remote teams \u2013 working from homes, coffee shops and co-working spaces across timezones \u2013 to produce better technology and business results in less time than purely office-based teams, while maintaining security and compliance standards.\n\nRemote-first culture flourishes when we share one simple principle: **Courtesy**. Courtesy means Mattermosters are thoughtful about keeping our communities appropriately informed, following etiquette for discussions, calls and video meetings, and giving and receiving feedback on how to work better together. Courtesy also means we gladly accommodate those who prefer to work out of a dedicated office. We are remote-first, not remote-only.\n\n**Communities-centered** means we define our success in the context of the success of our [communities](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/community-overview.html): users, customers, implementers, resellers, technology partners, contributors, and colleagues. The success of each community is owned by a member of the Mattermost leadership team. The plural definition of \u201ccommunities\u201d is intended to avoid unconsciously marginalizing downstream stakeholders.\n\n**Based in Palo Alto, California and headquartered on the internet** means the mailing address for Mattermost, Inc. is in Palo Alto, California, and our headquarters is on the internet, specifically the Mattermost instance at [https://community.mattermost.com](https://community.mattermost.com/). Our online headquarters is where Mattermost staff work with our communities of colleagues, users, partners, customer, and contributors, to envision, develop and refine new open source technologies to make the world safer and more productive.\n\n### [General Onboarding Activities](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding)\n\nWelcome to Mattermost! This is a general overview of activities that all staff should do within their first 90 days.

To make that happen we first have to create a great place to work\u2013an inclusive, courteous online community where incredibly talented individuals are empowered to do their best work for our customers, with very little in their way. This guide is a summary of our guiding principles. As Mattermost grows, we hope these principles serve each new staff person that joins us. If you're new to Mattermost, welcome! While the goals here are important, it\u2019s your ideas, talent, and energy that will keep Mattermost shining in the years ahead. Thanks for being here. Let\u2019s change the world.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/\">How to use our Handbook</a></h3>\n<p>Our handbook defines what it\u2019s like to work at Mattermost, from the high level to specific operating procedures. If you\u2019re new, you\u2019ll start with our onboarding guides.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#mission\">Our Mission</a></h3>\n<p>Our mission is to make the world safer and more productive by developing and delivering secure, open source collaboration software that is trusted, flexible and offers fast time-to-value.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles\">Leadership Principles</a></h3>\n<p>Leadership principles are deliberate choices defining our behavior. When facing complexity, uncertainty, or ambiguity (CUA) we determine our point of view and our actions through the lens of our values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Customer Obsession:</strong> We exist to make customers successful. In everything we do, start with customer perspective and work backwards. Earn and keep their trust.</li>\n<li><strong>Ownership:</strong> Own the outcomes of your activity. Don\u2019t drop the ball. When we see a vacuum on something important, we jump in \u2013 we never say \u201cit\u2019s not my job.\u201d</li>\n<li><strong>High-Impact:</strong> Align work to our shared vision and focus on those priorities. When deciding to work on low impact or high impact projects, choose high impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Self-Awareness:</strong> We understand and seek to understand our strengths and growth opportunities, as individuals and organizations. We are open to critique and share critique constructively and respectfully.</li>\n<li><strong>Earn Trust:</strong> Make decisions based on maximizing the trust of others in your judgement. Be open, self-critical, and factual. Earn and keep peoples' trust.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To view video of these Leadership Principles, please click <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cuxqePfpj2zy4DYLQ__DPtq2uJdGfwaL\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/overview/product.html\">Products</a></h3>\n<p>Mattermost Team Edition under MIT license and the Mattermost open source projects under various licenses are maintained by core committers, including both staff from Mattermost, Inc. and volunteer contributors from the Mattermost user and customer communities.</p>\n<p>Mattermost Enterprise Editions, which are commercial extensions built on top of the Mattermost open source projects, are developed, supported and sold by Mattermost, Inc.</p>\n<p>For more information, see our <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/overview/product.html\">Product Overview</a>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/business-model\">Company</a></h3>\n<p>Mattermost is an open source, remote-first, communities-centered company based in Palo Alto, California and headquartered on the internet.</p>\n<p><strong>Open source</strong> means that by default we make our technology, business process and source code available to the public. We develop a small portion as proprietary technology, built upon our open source work, to license for subscription fees that enable more high quality open source work to be produced. Since the start of the Mattermost open source project in 2015, we have used this model to develop effective open source solutions for the world to use. This model is sometimes called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model\">Thin Open Core</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Remote-first</strong> means that by default our staff works anywhere in the world where a) we have support for quality video calling and b) where we can work in a legally appropriate environment. Mattermost was born in an extraordinary age where organizations can attract, hire, and enable remote teams \u2013 working from homes, coffee shops and co-working spaces across timezones \u2013 to produce better technology and business results in less time than purely office-based teams, while maintaining security and compliance standards.</p>\n<p>Remote-first culture flourishes when we share one simple principle: <strong>Courtesy</strong>. Courtesy means Mattermosters are thoughtful about keeping our communities appropriately informed, following etiquette for discussions, calls and video meetings, and giving and receiving feedback on how to work better together. Courtesy also means we gladly accommodate those who prefer to work out of a dedicated office. We are remote-first, not remote-only.</p>\n<p><strong>Communities-centered</strong> means we define our success in the context of the success of our <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/process/community-overview.html\">communities</a>: users, customers, implementers, resellers, technology partners, contributors, and colleagues. The success of each community is owned by a member of the Mattermost leadership team. The plural definition of \u201ccommunities\u201d is intended to avoid unconsciously marginalizing downstream stakeholders.</p>\n<p><strong>Based in Palo Alto, California and headquartered on the internet</strong> means the mailing address for Mattermost, Inc. is in Palo Alto, California, and our headquarters is on the internet, specifically the Mattermost instance at <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/\">https://community.mattermost.com</a>. Our online headquarters is where Mattermost staff work with our communities of colleagues, users, partners, customer, and contributors, to envision, develop and refine new open source technologies to make the world safer and more productive.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding\">General Onboarding Activities</a></h3>\n<p>Welcome to Mattermost!

The goal of the Onboarding program is to welcome and enable new colleagues into a safe and compliant working environment with a strong sense of belonging within their first 90 days at Mattermost.\n\nOnboarding is an all-company partnership between a new colleague and Mattermost. Specifically this includes a new colleague\u2019s manager, functional and working teams, onboarding [peers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DQULEvgOhGeEGLTzdOlSvo858vo94zmnMN8sygi-lHk/edit?ts=5e21f202), [HR](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people#team) and MLT.\n\n## Post-Onboarding Readiness\n\nPost-Onboarding Readiness is an internal measure based on feedback throughout a new team member\u2019s first 90 days at Mattermost. There are multiple milestones throughout the onboarding process where feedback is solicited. This feedback assesses how willing and enabled a new colleague is to bring their best self to Mattermost as it relates to their role expectations, team and company focuses, and the Mattermost Leadership Principles.\n\nFeedback is requested from the new colleague's peers throughout the 90-day Onboarding. These consistent check-ins help new colleagues, People team, and managers iterate with impact quickly. For example, one of the [V2MOM - Destination Workplace Measures](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDSaeW-M92gth_NM1vI23dtbFLBsYVIk/edit#slide=id.g6f2ea8cda4_8_1852) is to have fewer than 5% questions repeat month-over-month.\n\n## Onboarding Feedback to Assess Post-Onboarding Readiness\n\n### Onboarding Surveys\n\nNew staff will be invited to share feedback of their onboarding experience after 30 days of working at Mattermost. FT Staff will receive an invitation via email to complete the 30-Day Onboarding Survey in Lattice. Early feedback from new hires is a crucial way to gather insights about what is going well and what needs to be improved in the onboarding process. The feedback shared in the survey will help the People team identify key areas to focus on to continue making Mattermost a great place to work.\n\n### New Staff Feedback Session with CEO and the People Team\n\nSimilar to [CEO listening tours](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-cadence#ceo-listening-tours) in this session, new colleagues are asked to share [likes and wishes](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#likes-and-wishes) about anything related to Mattermost and the Onboarding Program. This session with the CEO is scheduled 2 months after the start date of new staff.\n\nThe People Team will invite new staff members to a week-1 check-in. The check-in is an opportunity for new staff members to reflect on their first week, review resources, programs, policies, and tools, and ask the People Team questions. Here's a list of [questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eIffSDfWH24myJXZES1jOtfIZp9_xM6Swx5lWNdnxiM/edit) the People team will walk through together with the new staff member during the check-in.\n\n### New Colleague Feedback\n\nThe 90-Day Feedback provides a [360](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/performance-reviews-50#how-is-feedback-shared) [shoulder check](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#shoulder-check) for new team members, managers, [HR](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people#team), and MLT to understand and clarify potential blindspots as well as catch potential [brown M&Ms](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#brown-m-and-ms) early on.\n\nThis is not a formal performance review. The intent is to align expectations and improve performance early on. Peer feedback is not anonymous. Managers may need additional context from the panel to help increase the new colleague's performance and Post-Onboarding Readiness. Managers should keep peer feedback anonymous in the 90-Day Evaluation with the new colleague. Managers should also evaluate feedback based on their own expectations of the new colleague's role. In some cases, expectations may need to be reset with colleagues. Uncovering blindspots early on helps everyone avoid future confusion or misaligned efforts.\n\n### New Colleague 90-Day Feedback Process\n\n#### Managers\n\n* You will receive an email during your direct report's third month at Mattermost asking you to select a peer panel in Lattice. This kicks off the [review process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/performance-reviews-50#how-is-feedback-shared).\n* Log in to **Lattice &gt; Performance &gt; Task**. Designate the peer panel to provide feedback about your new staff member. For new hires who are also people managers, direct reports may also be included in the peer panel to provide upward feedback about their manager.\n* You'll be able to view the peer feedback and your new staff member's Self-Reflection when completing the manager portion of the 90-day review.\n* Complete the 90-day review and share it with your new staff member. Discuss the details of the review in a one-on-one.\n  * Note: This review is part of the Post-Onboarding Readiness metric assessment. This review is not a [formal review](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/performance-reviews-50/formal-review-process).\n\n#### New Colleagues\n\n* Complete the 90-Day Self-Reflection in Lattice. An email invitation to complete your 90-Day Self-Reflection in Lattice will be sent during your third month at Mattermost. To complete the Self-Reflection, log in to **Lattice &gt; Performance &gt; Task**.\n\n#### Peers\n\n* You will receive email invitations to share feedback about your new colleague. To complete your peer review, log in to **Lattice &gt; Performance &gt; Task**. Upward feedback may be requested if the new colleague is a people manager.\n\n",

This alignment includes panel focus areas ahead of, and as needed during, the interview processes.\n\n**Hiring Manager resources**\n\n* [Recruiting Playbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ziIFoI0dB0_WZZHBeGAy0BLNMafl0jGAdQ6Z7QA3Ah8/edit#heading=h.7m7dbckempjx) includes a list of all Hiring Manager responsibilities, as well as step-by-step instructions.

Managers should familiarize themselves with onboarding in order to appropriately fill in any gaps for their new staff member. New staff members will have an Onboarding Checklist of activities to complete and join during their first 90 days.\n\nWe will continue to iterate and add activities to the Onboarding Program. Managers should review these responsibilities ahead of every new hire joining Mattermost.\n\n**Pre-day one**\n\n* Complete the [Onboarding Systems Form in the IT HelpDesk](https://helpdesk.mattermost.com/support/home).\n* Complete the [onboarding template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OebRdaPStfmJL8mWiFKubmikQEJVk6wLu83W0z4Alec/edit#gid=0) prior to your new staff member's start date. Managers play a large role in setting their new direct report up for success and making them feel welcome by setting clear expectations and preparing the team and internal stakeholders for how they can help new colleagues integrate and connect organizationally and culturally.\n  * **Onboarding Objectives:** Clarify the areas and projects your new team member should focus on in their first 90 days. Use the [Overview of the Role](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rpTI2NKu4H_781vpx_eD9Fku7go4gGDs1P7bJAMQvAU/edit#bookmark=id.1lkghznrctji) that you completed when you opened the role. \n  * **AOR clarity:** Identify AORs that are relevant for your new hire, and indicate any AORs that your new hire will [DRI](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms#dri) or act as backup DRI.

In many ways, an Onboarding Peer may be an [end-boss](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#mini-boss-end-boss) for specific AORs. Managers should ask permission of a potential Onboarding Peer prior to assignment.\n\n**Week one**\n\n* Introduce our new staff member in the [Welcome Channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/welcome) using \\#newcolleague. Note: all new hires are asked to complete a short bio and share with their Managers. Managers should include this bio in the welcome message.\n* Review Team [AORs](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/areas-of-responsibility).

If they're not comfortable doing their own introduction, Managers will do so on their behalf.\n* [Shoulder Check](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#shoulder-check), assess potential blindspots and ask for feedback.\n\n**Month two**\n\n* **90-day New Colleague Feedback:** Managers are notified to kick off the [New Colleague Review Process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding#new-colleague-90-day-feedback-process) on their new staff member's 65th day. The feedback will include a summary of the new staff member's responsibilities during the first 90 days. Managers should communicate these responsibilities to the new staff member during their first week.\n\n**Month three**\n\n* Deliver New Colleague Feedback.\n\n#### People Manager's role in performance management\n\n* **Performance Reviews:** Managers will be invited to a [High Output Management Managers Session](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people/performance-reviews-50#high-output-management) ahead of writing a Performance Evaluation. Managers will need to read the [required chapter](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people/performance-reviews-50#high-output-management) of High Output Management ahead of the Session.

It's suggested to read the book during onboarding or upon becoming a Mnager at Mattermost.\n* **Performance Feedback:** Communicating explicitly is key in managing remote staff and teams and feedback is one of the most important tools a Manager has to set individuals and teams up for success.\n  * Managers should address [Brown M&Ms](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#brown-m-and-ms) and [Likes and Wishes](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#likes-and-wishes) in a timely manner to ensure expectations are aligned and to maintain asynchronous communication.\n  * [People Partners](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people#team) can help provide coaching and feedback on how to approach performance issues.\n\n",

Actionable \\(e.g. downloading the latest mobile app release, including links\\).\n4. Clear, concise, and consistent throughout.\n\n## Screenshot guidelines\n\n[Learn how to create screenshots and GIFs](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/messaging-and-math/how-to-guides-for-m-and-m/how-to-create-screenshots-and-gifs)\n\n## Language guidelines\n\n1. Use simple language with no buzzwords.\n2. Specify Desktop App or Mobile App if a feature is not dependent on the server release.\n3.

An end-user screenshot that best illustrates the feature.\n2. Screenshot of System Console or other settings help text.\n3. Screenshot of documentation.\n4. Screenshot of a code mentioning the feature and/or Mattermost.\n\n### Setup tips\n\n* Use the Mattermost Desktop App, which has a nicer border.\n* Create a secondary account with \\[first.last\\]+blah@mattermost.com email address. This makes triggering notifications for yourself easier \\(for the screenshot\\). You can also use a second browser to login to the second account while taking the screenshot.\n\n### Checklist\n\n* **Screen size:**\n  * Size your Mattermost Desktop App or browser to capture a screenshot approximately 900px by 640px, excluding browser navigation.\n  * Use default 100% zoom.\n  * Tip: Close the right-hand sidebar, and close the team sidebar by leaving all but one team.\n* **Font size:**\n  * All text should have large enough font size so that text is easily readable.\n* **Visuals:**\n  * Profile pictures and real people\u2019s names should be filled out throughout the screenshot.\n  * For the profile picture, use either normal-looking Avatars or stock photography from [istockphoto.com](https://www.istockphoto.com/).\n  * Select the default \"Mattermost\" theme color in **Account Settings &gt; Theme**.\n* **Left-hand sidebar:**\n  * Include Favorite, Public, and Private channels on the left-hand sidebar.\n  * Make sure that you scroll all the way to the top in the channel list on the left-hand sidebar for the screenshot.\n  * You can have a few unreads or mentions visible, but don't include an \u201cunread posts\u201d indicator in the left-hand sidebar.\n* **Favorites channel list**: Include the following:\n  * One Public channel.\n  * One Direct Message channel with someone who is online.\n  * One Group Direct Message channel using people with short names to avoid truncation.\n* **Center pane:**\n  * Make the center pane one of the Favorited channels.\n  * Make sure that the heading of the center pane is fully visible to avoid truncation.\n  * Make the first message in the center pane fully visible right below the channel header.\n* **Team list**\n  * Connect team names to channel names, e.g. Contributors, Developers, Toolkit, etc. to contribute to a broader overall theme and story.\n  * E.g. could use icons of different maps, or city skylines, to indicate offices of different teams, or business units of a bank \\(customer service, security, research, etc.\\), etc.\n* **Clarity:** \n  * Avoid showing any text with acronyms and abbreviations.\n  * Do not show any bugs or defects.\n* **Outline:**\n  * Ensure that the screenshot has a grey \\(\\#F7F9FA\\) outline in all four edges.

If you share screenshots in a slide with a drop shadow or other formatting, make sure the original is provided as a backup in case the user needs a different manipulation.\n2. **Share the manipulation \\(optional\\):** If you're modifying screenshots using a format that can include layer or the original manipulation \\(e.g. Photoshop\\), offer the file containing modifications if you can in .PSD or .TIF format.\n\n### Recording a GIF\n\nUse [GIF Brewery](https://gfycat.com/gifbrewery) to create GIFs. Ensure there are no watermarks or vendor names overlaying the GIF.\n\n### Do's and Don'ts\n\n#### Don't zoom past 100% and pixelated images\n\nWhen you need to show a particular part of the product, don't crop the image and zoom past 100% to show the functionality. Screenshots should be full-sized \\(no zoom-in, no resizing within Google Doc\\), potentially stored in a .TIF file. For optimal quality on Mac screenshots, [see this help article](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/30081/highest-quality-website-screenshot/30142#30142).\n\nExample of what not to do:\n\n![DO NOT use Zoom level other than 100% for screenshots](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29%20%284%29.png)\n\n#### Do show sub-components framed in grey \\(\\#F7F9FA\\) background\n\nInstead, show the sub-component at 100% zoom with a 12pt white border \\(so there's white space\\) and a grey \\(\\#F7F9FA\\) background with no border, so the image is neatly framed:\n\n![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%288%29%20%281%29.png)\n\n#### Don't display watermarks and vendor names on screenshots or GIFs\n\nExample of what not to do \\(\"Stop\" and \"created with gifrecorder.com\" overlayed at the end of the GIF\\):\n\n![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2825%29.png)\n\n#### Don't take a screenshot at high resolution\n\nText is hard to read when image is reduced for sharing on blog posts, social media and possibly in slides:\n\n![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2827%29%20%281%29.png)\n\n#### Do size Mattermost to capture approximately a 900px by 640px area\n\nThis enables sharing the image in documentation, social media, and marketing content more easily.\n\n![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2816%29%20%287%29.png)\n\n",

Be welcoming and use inviting and inclusive language. For example, when asking someone to take action, use \u201cWould you be open to\u201d instead of \u201cWould you like to\u201d.\n2. **Use the active voice.** Avoid words and phrases like \u201chas\u201d, \u201cwas\u201d, and \u201chave been\u201d when possible. For example, say \u201cOur hackathon starts now!\u201d instead of \u201cOur hackathon has started\u201d.\n3. **Include one link in each tweet.** Provide a clear call to action by placing a link at the end of each tweet. This may not apply to retweets and responses.\n4. **Don\u2019t tweet about sensitive topics.** Avoid controversy. Sensitive topics include, but are not limited to, unflattering news about our competitors, items that disparage governments, companies, people or other entities, and political/religious content. Not sure if a certain topic is sensitive? Leave it alone.\n5. **Don\u2019t disparage other open source projects.** We fully support the open source community.\n6. **Write so an international audience can understand you.** Avoid colloquialisms, hyperbole, slang, and jargon. Use simple language. Avoid acronyms when possible. For example, say \u201cpull request\u201d instead of \u201cPR\u201d since only a subset of tweet readers are active GitHub users.\n7. **Use exclamation marks sparingly.** An exclamation mark can be used when an announcement is exciting, but should be avoided when it can be confused with a signal to panic, e.g., \u201cSecurity update released!\u201d.\n8. **Try to avoid putting anything in a negative light.** Be an optimist. For example, instead of writing \u201cAPIv3 is deprecated, \u201dwrite \u201cAPIv4 has officially replaced APIv3\u201d. Instead of writing \u201cbug fixes,\u201d write \u201cperformance improvements\u201d.\n9. **Post during the workday when possible.** The best time to post to Twitter during the workweek is between 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. local time. \\(The official Mattermost account considers the Eastern Time Zone local time.\\) Avoid posting to Twitter on the weekend or on holidays unless it\u2019s urgent.\n10. **Add images to tweets when possible/it makes sense.** Images increase engagement.

        "content": "---\ndescription: 50% draft\n---\n\n# How to write Mattermost Case Studies\n\n## Case studies\n\nThis document outlines some of the procedures and materials in developing an effective case study for Mattermost software. This template can be used both to describe deployments of the open source Mattermost Team Edition or commercial deployments with Mattermost Enterprise Edition. We\u2019re delighted to hear everyone\u2019s story and to share it with the community.\n\n### What to know about technical case sStudies\n\nCase studies are valuable for any audience, but for technical audiences they provide a great opportunity to show off the potential value of your product to an audience that often bristles at conventional marketing. With that in mind, here are a few things to focus on when creating case studies for developers, security architects, quality engineers, and other technical buyers:\n\n* **Context matters.** Capturing the broader landscape of our customers\u2019 workflow and tooling, and how Mattermost fits into that landscape is essential.\n\n  Don\u2019t forget time to value. Technical folks know that a new tool isn\u2019t often something that will be ready to use \u201cout of the box,\u201d so case studies can be a good place to show that set up and maintenance won\u2019t be a major issue.\n\n* **Get the right people in the room.** The value that a CTO gets from a product and the value that a developer gets can be very different conversations. If you\u2019re not speaking with the right person, you might get a lot of vague answers to key questions.\n\nTaken from Ashley\u2019s guide to [Writing Case Studies for a Technical Audience](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18UL7LNOIcYkZ4NEF-aeDfhXDq7pyoSvwvEq9hmLrKks/edit#) for Heavybit.\n\n### Case study requirements\n\nOur goal with case studies is to highlight our most successful customers and share how they're benefiting from using Mattermost. Our general requirements:\n\n* Customer has completed a deployment of Mattermost.\n* Customer\u2019s use case aligns with a use case we want to emulate.\n* Customer has been actively using Mattermost for at least three months.\n* Customer has general approval to participate in case studies and other promotion materials, i.e., there are no bans on participation.\n\n### Case study process\n\nMattermost, Inc. is excited to highlight interesting use cases from across our customer base to bring attention to your company and how it\u2019s benefiting from using Mattermost.\n\nThe process is approximately as follows:\n\n1. Customer meets the above Case Study Requirements outlined above.\n2. Customer case study contact is introduced to a Mattermost case study coordinator over email and completes a questionnaire \\(below\\).\n3. Mattermost case study coordinator arranges a 30-minute phone or video call with the customer for a discussion around the questionnaire and deployment.\n4. One to two weeks later a draft case study is sent to the customer for review and approval \\(in a shared Google document\\). Customer is asked to complete reviews within 3-5 business days and is given a target publication date.\n5. Mattermost case study coordinator and case study owner take turns to politely follow up with the customer either the day before the customer has stated that the review will be ready, in order to confirm that the review is coming, or approximately every 2 business days after the initial 3-5 day window if an estimate of the draft case study review time is not known.\n   * In follow-up emails, it is important to take into consideration what can be done for the customer, rather than what the customer can do for us, e.g. \u201cCircling back to see if there is anything I can do to help the case study review proceed more smoothly? Happy to help, just let me know.\u201d\n6. When the customer has completed a review of the draft case study and approved it, the customer feedback is incorporated into the draft blog post in Google Docs.\n7. Mattermost case study coordinator prepares for publication:\n   * Commissions a banner to be featured in the case study blog post. Please see \u201cMarketing: Graphics\u201d channel for examples on how to commission banners.\n   * Creates a draft blog post  to promote the case study in WordPress. The draft is then reviewed for formatting, grammar, and other [style guidelines](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-processes/publishing/publishing-guidelines/voice-tone-and-writing-style-guidelines).\n   * Drafts social media posts to promote the case study.\n8. The blog post is then published and may be used in other marketing materials to share the benefits of a Mattermost solution with other potential customers.\n   * The case study coordinator follows up with the customer to share a link to the final case study, thank them for participating, and encourage them to share on their company's social channels.\n9. Case study owner writes a description of the case study with key details, to be shared with Sales, Customer Success, and other teams.\n   * Ex. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to introduce our latest case study with Worldline. Worldline first started using Mattermost because they needed a more secure alternative to Slack. Mattermost gives Worldline a central collaboration space that its distributed team uses to find information, organize projects, and speed up development workflows using the Mattermost GitLab plugin.\u201d\n\n### Customer questionnaire\n\nThe below customer questionnaire template helps us gather information to share with the Mattermost community on your business, your needs, and how Mattermost can help serve your organization.\n\n> We\u2019d love your help answering some of these questions, either in email or over a phone call or video conference, to prepare a case study draft for your organization\u2019s review and approval.\n>\n> Please contact your Mattermost Marketing contact to get started.\n>\n> #### Business information\n>\n> Help us understand your current company\u2019s challenges and goals, and how they fit into the landscape of your industry.\n>\n> * How long have you been in business?\n> * How many employees do you have?\n> * What are some of the objectives of your department at this time?\n>\n> #### Need\n>\n> Please help share some context on the need for a solution.\n>\n> * What did your processes/workflow look like before using Mattermost?\n> * What challenges and objectives led you to look for a solution?\n> * What might have happened if you didn't identify a solution?\n> * Did you explore other solutions prior to this that didn't work out? If so, what happened?\n>\n> #### Decision process\n>\n> Help us understand how you arrived at a decision to use Mattermost \\(this will help other potential customers through their own process\\).\n>\n> * How did you hear about our product or service?\n> * Who was involved in the selection process?\n> * What was most important to you when evaluating your options?\n>\n> #### Implementation\n>\n> We\u2019re very interested in learning about your onboarding procedure.\n>\n> * How long did it take to get up and running?\n> * Did that meet your expectations?\n> * Who was involved in the process?\n>\n> #### Solution in action\n>\n> Please share how the solution is used today.\n>\n> * Is there a particular aspect of the product or service that you rely on most?\n> * Who is using the product or service?\n> * What are some of the top use cases for the solution?\n> * What other software/tools do you use as part of your workflow? What integrations do you have with Mattermost?\n>\n> #### Results\n>\n> Please share the most impressive measurable outcomes you can think of \u2013 the more numbers, the better.\n>\n> * How is the product or service helping you save time and increase productivity?\n> * In what ways does that enhance your competitive advantage?\n> * How much have you increased key metrics, such as reducing response time, time-to-resolution, and reducing time spent in meetings?\n>\n> If you\u2019re completing the questionnaire by email, please send a copy of the questions completed above to your Mattermost Marketing contact for next steps.\n>\n> Thank you so much for being part of our community!\n\n### Case study interview process\n\n* The call will take place after the customer case study contact has completed the above questionnaire.\n* The case study writer should also be on the call.\n* At the beginning of the call, the customer is asked if they\u2019re in agreement that the interview be recorded to ensure accurate note-taking. Once agreed, the interview is then recorded via Zoom and the recording is transcribed after the call.\n* A draft of the case study, in appropriate format, is sent to the customer for review 1-2 weeks after the call.\n\n### Writing guidelines\n\n1. Don't use slang or jargon. Write so that people with English as a second language can understand every sentence.\n2. Don't criticize the competition or disparage other products. It\u2019s okay to factually address differences on why Mattermost was selected.\n3. Don't mention staff size if less than 250 people.\n4. Don't use hyperbole \\(e.g. \u201cgame changing\u201d\\).\n\n### Written case study layout\n\nFollow these steps to write a case study that is clear and concise:\n\n1. **Title:** Highlight the most compelling use case and/or business benefit from Results section \\(see step \\#6 below\\).\n2. **Executive Summary:**\n   1. Open with a sentence on how the organization transformed after using Mattermost.\n   2. Include the most important points of the story.\n3. **Organization \\(3-5 sentences\\):**\n   1. Introduce the customer and their industry, framing their relevance and impact on the world in the first 1 or 2 sentences.\n   2. Optionally include a sentence with facts about the company such as location and founding date at the end of this section.\n4. **Challenges:**\n   1. One to two sentences on the problem\\(s\\) the company faced before using Mattermost. Then elaborate on the consequences of the problem, including quotations as appropriate.\n   2. One sentence on the goal they sought to achieve and criteria for a solution \\(which may introduce new requirements not included in the previous section, e.g. budget, timeline, expanding user base, etc.\\).\n5. **Solutions:** Describe how Mattermost provided a solution to the customer\u2019s goal and addressed its challenges.\n6. **Results:**\n   1. Include 3-5 specific use cases with clear business value \\(e.g. incident response, new employee Q&A center, etc.\\).\n   2. Include business benefits that do one of three things i\\) increase revenue, ii\\) decrease cost, iii\\) drive efficiency.\n   3. Add customer testimonials that show how Mattermost helped achieve the customer\u2019s goals. Include specific examples and quotations.\n\nThese case study procedures draw heavily from Hubspot\u2019s [How to Write a Case Study](https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33282/the-ultimate-guide-to-creating-compelling-case-studies.aspx) article.\n\n## For customers: Case study FAQs\n\n**How much of a time commitment is participating in a Mattermost case study?**\n\nWe do our best to make case studies as quick and straightforward as possible.

Note that all posts will require some amount of customization depending on the audience, topic, and purpose of the content.\n\nContent development and distribution is tracked in our [Editorial Calendar in Asana](https://app.asana.com/0/1118354383664913/board).\n\n| Activities | Owner |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Planning** |  |\n| Post concept is developed/approved by Editorial team | Ashley/Jason |\n| Post concept is developed/approved by technical lead | R&D |\n| Preliminary deadline/timeline set | Ashley |\n| **Drafting** |  |\n| Post is outlined/drafted by author | Post Author/Ashley |\n| If graphics are required, they should be commissioned/collected during this phase | Ashley/Justin |\n| **Review** |  |\n| Technical posts: Fact-checked | Jason B., R&D leadership team |\n| Partner Content: Sent to collaborators for review | Relationship owner \\(Aaron, Jason, Ashley, etc.\\) |\n| All Content: Post is proofread and optimized for SEO | Ashley/Justin |\n| Distribution Checklist is added to post draft | Ashley/Justin |\n| **Scheduling** |  |\n| Finalized post & graphics uploaded to WordPress | Justin |\n| Social posts are uploaded to HootSuite | Justin |\n| Additional distribution collateral/messaging finalized | Ashley/Jason B. |\n| **Distribution \\(See Distribution Checklist for complete activities\\)** |  |\n| Send internal, collaborator & community notifications | Ashley/Jason B. |\n| Submit link to appropriate channels \\(e.g. Reddit, HN\\) | Ashley/Jason B./Author |\n| Post to self-submission syndication channels \\(e.g. Opensource.com, Dev.to\\) | Ashley/Jason B./Author |\n| Add to nurture campaigns | Ashley/Ty/TBD |\n| **Performance Evaluation** |  |\n| Review performance at next monthly review cycle \\(Content Strategy Mtg\\) | Ashley/Jason |\n| Queue additional social reposts/resubmit to syndication channels as needed | Ashley/Justin |\n\n## Product content workflows\n\nThere are several kinds of recurring content coming from the Product team. These have their own creation & launch processes:\n\n### Monthly product releases\n\nEvery month the product team drafts a [release announcement](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/messaging-and-math/how-to-guides-for-m-and-m/how-to-create-release-announcements) for alternating product and quality releases. Blog post copy and any relevant screenshots, images, or videos should are shared with the Editorial team ahead of the 16th of every month.\n\n**Blog Posts**\n\nThese posts skip ahead to the Proofread & Distribution Prep stages of content creation and should be scheduled as close as possible to the 16th.\n\n**Monthly Newsletter**\n\nUsing the release copy as a template, the Editorial team \\[Justin\\] will draft copy for the monthly email newsletter. This copy is passed to the Marketing Ops owner \\[TBD\\] to upload into Marketo for sending. A test email is sent to Justin & Ashley for final approval before the email is scheduled.\n\n### Integration releases\n\nIntegrations and plugins are not released in cadence with other product releases, but are often critically important to the adoption of Mattermost by users.\n\n**Spotlight/round-Up plugin blog post**\n\nIn order to highlight releases, we\u2019ll do an additional integration release announcement between product releases \\(the first of the month or closest business day\\). About two weeks ahead of launch date \\(or earlier\\), Aaron R. will flag plugins that will be highlighted in the next integrations launch.\n\nThese posts can be focused around a single \u201cspotlight\u201d feature or compile multiple new/existing plugins that fit a specific theme. Content will be repurposed for an email sendout to subscribers that will follow the same workflow as the Monthly Newsletter.\n\n_Ex.\\) Jitsi Launch: Compile the 3 posts about Jitsi \\(technical, thought leadership, feature spotlight\\) into a single roundup highlighting this new plugin._\n\n_Ex.\\) CI/CD Plugins: To highlight the new Nimbella plugin, surface several other popular CI/CD plugins and write about how they can be leveraged separately or together._\n\n### R&D demos\n\nWeekly feature demos given during the weekly R&D meeting \\(Thursday\\) are edited and repurposed to be posted on YouTube and shared on our social media channels the following Tuesday. Each demo will yield several 2-3 minute demo clips.\n\nBranding and workflow TBD.\n\n## Distribution checklist\n\nEvery new piece of content developed and launched by Mattermost will require some amount of distribution to ensure that it reaches its intended audience. While every content launch will require some degree of customization, most will adhere to the following process.\n\n### Social launch\n\n* **Post link on social channels.** Social content queueing is handling via Hootsuite. Social posts should include an image, link, and hashtags. \n  * All content: Twitter\n  * Recruiting and Buyer persona content: Twitter, LinkedIn \n  * Company updates and big news: Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook\n\n### Internal/collaborator notifications\n\n* **Send thank you note to collaborators with link to Tweet to share**\n* **Share internally/with community with link to Tweet to share**\n* **For sales collateral:**\n  * Share additional collateral with sales/CSM/support teams\n  * Case study/use case slides with quotes & talking points\n\n### Link sharing\n\n* **Post link on Hacker News**\n* **Post link on subreddits.** The following are subreddits that we have shared content on in the past. Please review subreddit-specific posting requirements BEFORE posting any content. \n  * /r/Mattermost\n  * /r/opensource\n  * /r/golang\n  * /r/reactjs\n  * /r/kubernetes\n\n### Syndication\n\n* **Repost to syndication channels**\n  * Dev.to\n  * HackerNoon\n  * DZone\n  * Opensource.com\n  * Github Readme Project\n  * Glassdoor.com\n\n### Additional activities\n\n* Add to Mattermost nurture campaigns\n* Submit links to 3rd party mailing lists, such as Pointer.io\n\n## Distribution template\n\nDuring the Review phase of content creation, a copy of the Distribution Template will be added to the Draft. The Editorial team will use this template to draft social copy and develop a distribution plan for that individual post.\n\n| Distribution Template \\[for Editorial Team use\\] |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Social Posts | _Draft copy for 3 social posts here, including hashtags_ |\n| Artwork/Graphics | _Link to social & post art or graphics here_ |\n| Internal & collaborator messaging | _Draft internal messaging here_ |\n| 3rd party forums & roundups | _What link sharing sites/forums/email lists should this post be posted to?_ |\n| 3rd party syndication | _What communities should this post be submitted to?_ |\n| Other campaigns | _Should this post be added to existing nurture campaigns?_ |\n\nFor a copyable template and examples of this Distribution template, [visit this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19iDIxs8X7TdtgD1rt4o6kA3cZLO8JUTgg6e17_NDWAg/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n",

The guidelines should give you an idea of how to:\n\n* Aim for the correct audience\n* Create great video content\n* Record high-quality videos\n* Publish video content\n* Promote your video content\n\n## What is video content used for?\n\nVideo content provides a dynamic experience for viewers and can add personality and context to a topic where written content cannot. We should use video content when video provides the best audience experience for a piece of content. Some examples include discussions between two or more people and tutorials with complex or highly visual workflows.\n\nVideos can also be helpful for repurposing live events and sessions for longer term use. This includes presentations at live events and internal product demos.\n\nWhile video content is great, it isn\u2019t always the best option for a public-facing asset, even when raw footage has already been recorded. If you aren't sure if a piece of content would be a good fit for video content, don't be afraid to ask!\n\n## Setting up your recording environment\n\nGreat video content starts with a clean recording. If you know that a session will be used for video content, aim for getting as high quality as possible. Some tips for getting the best raw content:\n\n* **Use a good microphone:** As an audiophile friend used to say, \u201canything is better than your laptop\u2019s mic.\u201d\n* **Improve your lighting:** Natural light is always best; check different locations to figure out where your lighting will be flattering and clear.\n* **Eliminate audio and visual clutter:** Select a good time to record, if possible; if light in your office is great in the morning but dungeon-like in the afternoon, or if your street has a lot of loud traffic between 3-5.\n* **Do a quick check of your \u201crecording\u201d room:** Is there a basket of laundry sitting on the table in the background? Is your door open? Are your roommates likely to start knocking around the kitchen? Do what you can to minimize distractions before you get started.\n* **Include buffer time to your recording:** Don\u2019t start and stop recording right away - it\u2019s good to give a few seconds of buffer between the beginning and end of the video so there's a smooth transition.\n* **Don\u2019t be afraid of do-overs:** If you\u2019re recording something specifically for video distribution \\(not live\\) and something happens - a police car goes by outside, cat knocks over your mic, you say the wrong word - feel free to stop, take a breath, and redo that section.\n* **Take notes:** If your co-speaker mentions a customer that we shouldn\u2019t discuss publicly, or you need to redo something, time-stamped notes are helpful for making the editing process faster and easier.\n\n_An additional note for recording webinars, meetings, and other large-group calls: If there are more people than the speakers on the call being recorded, have them mute their mics and turn off their webcams before the recorded section begins. You can opt to hide participants who are not visible in your Zoom settings. This helps keep the recording free of visual and audio clutter._\n\n## Post-production/video processing workflow\n\n### What to prepare\n\n* A description of the video\n* Raw video\\(s\\) for editing\n* Transcript \\(if available\\)\n* Title and end cards \\(as needed\\)\n* Notes:\n  * Where does the video start? Where does it end? \n  * Do multiple videos need to be edited together?\n  * Are there any sections that need to be removed?\n  * Are there any sound or video quality issues that should be checked?\n\n### Submitting to Fiverr\n\nFor video editing we use Fiverr vendors to prepare polished videos. The following are our preferred vendors:\n\n* Watchclosely\n* Graphifyme\n* matteo505\n\n### Reviews and edits\n\nMinimize the number of edits and stakeholders for any given video, and be prompt with giving feedback to Fiverr editors. Fiverr tickets close automatically after three days, so be mindful of getting your feedback in quickly.\n\nEditing should include:\n\n* Editorial owner\n* \\(Optional\\) Internal stakeholders, e.g. a developer who gave a presentation on an upcoming feature\n* \\(Optional\\) External stakeholders, e.g. a customer who participates in a video case study\n\n## Preparing finished videos for publication\n\nMattermost videos are hosted on YouTube, which has a very simple upload workflow. Upload the video via YouTube Studio and include the following metadata:\n\n* Thumbnail image\n* Video title\n* Video description\n* Tags\n\nIf video is going to be available on our YouTube channel, assign it to appropriate playlists. If video will not be available on YouTube \\(e.g. a customer testimonial that will only be embedded on the Customers page\\), do not assign it to playlists and set state to \u201cUnlisted\u201d \\(not \u201cPrivate\u201d\\).\n\nFor access to our YouTube channel, ping @hanna.park.\n\n## Video content distribution\n\nVideo content may be promoted as part of a blog post, guide or other larger content campaign, or it may require its own dedicated campaign. Follow best practices for our [Content Distribution process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/messaging-and-math/content-marketing/content-development-distribution-processes).\n\n",

In H2 2020, we\u2019re focused on building and executing a [strong foundation of content marketing best practices](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/messaging-and-math/content-marketing/content-development-distribution-processes) and building out a pipeline of content initiatives around the [key topics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sVwlZN56dQYy-QVOXtYwlRgAOMaz80Mcl86jzx0KOPE/edit#) for [a few target audiences](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GxrnTj6FbFul1MJqCttFe7gt5-gz-OCEg8gzfipLLrI/edit?ts=5f222db3).\n\n## What are our goals?\n\nFor H2 2020, our content marketing goals are as follows:\n\n* [Publishing six customer stories](https://app.asana.com/0/1181403834255289/1194040652702369/f) \\(case studies, logos, blog interview, webinars\\) by end of H2 2020.\n* Individual content initiatives are 60% increasing our audience, 20% advancing prospects through pipeline, and 20% enabling sales and champions, and every content initiative has a clearly documented and executed distribution plan.\n* Our [Editorial calendar](https://app.asana.com/0/1190898966199137/list) is set at least two weeks out on a rolling basis.\n* Every member of the company understands [how they can get involved](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/messaging-and-math/content-marketing/contributing-content) in developing and promoting Mattermost content.\n\n## Key resources\n\n* [Content V2MOM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_YhnLS2b4tMslOI5St7daGdfteYaFoZPNbPOErD7v54/edit#) \\(or see chart below\\)\n* [Mattermost Product Differentiation Strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16ip7CSpjG3eX_sL7PABgrkIk51rdN2kCfxeahaIQpUA/edit)\n* [Audiences](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GxrnTj6FbFul1MJqCttFe7gt5-gz-OCEg8gzfipLLrI/edit?ts=5f222db3)\n* [Content Themes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sVwlZN56dQYy-QVOXtYwlRgAOMaz80Mcl86jzx0KOPE/edit#)\n* [Editorial Calendar](https://app.asana.com/0/1190898966199137/list)\n* [Mattermost Style Guide](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-processes/publishing/publishing-guidelines/voice-tone-and-writing-style-guidelines)\n* [Content Development & Distribution Workflow](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/messaging-and-math/content-marketing/content-development-distribution-processes)\n\n## Content V2MOM\n\n|  | Content V2MOM |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Vision | Connect our audience\u2019s priorities to our brand and the future of their industries through story. |\n| Values | Audience Obsessed, High Standards, Balancing Short- and Long-term Growth |\n| Methods |  _Execute on content calendar and distribution process that focuses on high impact themes and topics_  Develop and iterate on contributor, customer, and partner content programs \\* Uplevel SEO practices and site UX to improve content relevance and stickiness |\n| Obstacles |  _Alignment with product roadmap_  Misunderstanding audience needs  _Not focusing on high impact partner and customer stories_  Neglecting SEO groundwork |\n| Metrics |  _Publish and promote 6 case studies in H2_  Content programs are documented, socialized, and vacation-ready \\* 80% of the time the field has the content they need |\n\n## Content team\n\n* Ashley Dotterweich: Head of Content\n* Jason Blais: Lead Product Manager \\(Community\\)\n* Justin Reynolds: Copywriter\n\n## Content neetings and channels\n\nWant to join these meetings/channels or learn more about them?

To create a new task using a template, right-click the Template you want to use and select **Duplicate Task**. The task will automatically be added to **Inbound Topics**.\n\n## Task Workflow\n\nEvery piece of content moves through the same general workflow for creation, review, scheduling, and distribution. This is reflected in the **Board View** of the Asana project.\n\n### Inbound topics\n\nWhen new content ideas and topics are shared with other members of the team, they should be added to **Inbound Topics** with the status **\\[REVIEW\\] Inbound Idea**. This helps us capture and triage new post ideas and ensure that our backlog stays healthy.\n\nTasks in this category may need to be approved by external or internal collaborators before moving forward. For example, technical content must be reviewed by R&D team leads before it's confirmed. For more on this process, please refer to our [Content Development and Distribution Processes](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/messaging-and-math/content-marketing/content-development-distribution-processes).\n\n### Planned and In Progress\n\nOnce we\u2019re sure that we\u2019ll move forward with developing a piece of content, the Asana ticket is moved to **Planned** if it hasn't yet been started. When it's underway, it's moved to **In Progress**.\n\nIn order to move into **In Progress** a post _must_ have an assigned author/contributor.\n\n### Pending Review\n\nAll content requires an SEO/grammar review by the Editorial Team, and many pieces also require a technical review or external approval before they're ready for publication. Please add any internal reviewers to the Asana ticket during this stage, and make a comment for any additional/external reviewers.\n\n### Publication Prep\n\nPosts are moved to **Publication Prep** when they're fully reviewed. This status indicates to the Editorial Team that the post is completely approved to go live.\n\n### Scheduled\n\nScheduled posts that are fully loaded into WordPress and have social media content scheduled are moved into **Scheduled**. This gives the Editorial Team an at-a-glance overview of content that's ready to be published.\n\nOur goal is to have the Editorial Calendar scheduled about two weeks out, allowing us to avoid last-minute scrambles to complete content!\n\nNote that **Scheduled** posts still need to be distributed manually \\(syndicated to third-parties, posted to Reddit, etc.\\).\n\n### Done\n\nWhen all publication activities are completed, the post is moved to **Done** and no further action is needed. Completed posts should be reviewed in the next Content Strategy review cycle, [during the first meeting of the month](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/messaging-and-math/content-marketing#editorial-channels-and-meetings).\n\n## Editorial calendar fields\n\nEvery content task has a number of fields that help us track campaigns more easily. They allow anyone who is editing or preparing a post for publication to have all the information they need to get the job done.\n\n* **Assignee:** The name of the person responsible for moving the post to whatever its next state is; for many stages, this person will be on the Marketing team.\n* **Due date:** The date that the post is set to go live.\n* **Tags:** The high-level Content Themes that the post is associated with. A task may have multiple tags associated with it. There are currently five tags in use for content:\n  * **Open Source for Enterprise**\n  * **DevOps Workflow**\n  * **Remote Collab**\n  * **Product:** Use this for product releases, product-specific how-to\u2019s, and other content.\n  * **Developer:** Use this for any content that should be cross-posted to the Developer blog.\n* **Status:** Statuses are set to change automatically as a task is moved through different sections of the Asana board. Additional automation may be integrated in the future.\n* **Content Type:** Content types help the Editorial Team plan for the specific development and distribution activities for different content formats of content, e.g. building sales collateral for case studies. Please try to use existing content types where possible.\n* **Byline:** The name of the person \\(or people\\) who will be credited as the author of the content, where applicable.\n* **Draft/Link:** A link to the Google Doc, WordPress entry, or other source of content.\n* **Description:** Any notes on the content that are not captured in other fields.\n",

Colleagues who come from companies that aren't obsessed with customers have suggested we refer to this meeting as \"All Hands\" and not expect everything we announce - from [spending company money](../finance/staff-member-expenses/how-to-spend-company-money.md) to [recruiting new talent](../../contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting.md) - to be framed in the context of serving customers.

Usually to align company on short and long term objectives, to reiterate larger vision for the company, or to emphasize leadership principles.\n   * **Good News:** News or updates shared by team members.\n   * **Week 2 Welcomes:** New team members introduced on their second week by their manager, or optionally by the new team member themselves.\n   * **Main Topics:** Align and educate team around challenges faced by Enterprise customers and around department near-term goals. Examples include: FOSDEM event highlights and learnings; Enterprise customer's path from pilot to production; department VPMOM share; key updates, use cases or stories from customers.\n     * Links to publicly shared documents or slides may be included in meeting notes.\n   * **Feedback:** At end of meeting, conclude meeting with a reminder to share feedback via survey.\n\n### After meeting\n\n1. \\(Chair\\) Share meeting recording \\(viewable only by signed-in users and non-downloadable\\) and link to feedback survey. [See an example here](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/pl/nai7nsr61jnbzd67kg37853ybc). **Note:** Include the hashtag `#com-recording` somewhere in the post.\n2. \\(Chair\\) Post a link to the meeting recording in the header of the [Customer Obsession Meeting channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/cust-obs-meeting) and in the meeting notes.\n3. \\(Chair\\) Collect feedback from survey and add to next meeting's draft agenda for Chair and Co-Chairs to review.\n4. \\(Presenter\\) Any presenter that introduces a new acronym needs to include this in the [Mattermost Acronyms Focalboard](https://community.mattermost.com/boards/workspace/orw8z8yajpd9fgxtuijq31eqkh/bemqt6wf847fsdjoeobkor8ucye/vu8rm3mniwp8jbmtr6xkxpwor8r).\n\n## Staff enablement survey\n\nEvery 6 months we'll be asking staff to spend around 3 minutes completing a [staff enablement survey of 12 engagement questions](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/hr-cadences#staff-enablement-survey), plus identifying their organizational leader.\n\n* The enablement survey will be announced in COM one week before the survey goes live.\n* The survey link will be shared at the beginning of COM.\n* The link will be posted in the COM channel with \"Thumbs Up\" emoji reaction.\n* All staff are asked to complete the survey and signal completion by clicking on \"Thumbs Up\".\n* Ideally, the meeting will conclude after \"Thumbs Up\" count reaches attendee count but this is not a requirement.\n* An analysis of the results should be prepared and presented within the next 2 - 4 weeks in COM.\n\nLinks to previous staff enablement surveys:\n\n* [March 2019 staff enablement survey](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bkUQOCvJyYX-695gpZI7SJal14AWefFx5fJQxTOJKlI/edit#slide=id.g730cbfe72a_0_393)\n* [September 2019 staff enablement survey](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qArPEreSsI3cuSoW0GWdr02L_nIe_-OyCR0_sI2-0Qc/edit#slide=id.p)\n* [March 2020 staff enablement survey](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bkUQOCvJyYX-695gpZI7SJal14AWefFx5fJQxTOJKlI/edit#slide=id.g730cbfe72a_0_9)\n* [April 2021 staff enablement survey](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16rKYpHDUQ8aghsmwEJwhXMMSZWldm1t7Y4nPhv5uj-4/edit)\n\n## CEO Listening Tours\n\nListening to feedback is vital to iteration and to continually improve everything we do.\n\nFeedback and listening is at the core of our self-awareness leadership principle. We have 1-1s with managers, regular pulse and engagement surveys, People team outreach and conversations, and annonymous feedback available in every weekly Customer Obsession/All-Hands Meeting. CEO Listening Tours are another way we listen.\n\nCEO Listening Tours happen over Zoom in meetings around 25-30 minutes with different groups of 5-8 staff, typically within the same department or in a related function. Managers of the team members in the group are typically not included in the meeting.\n\nSome notes about Listening Tours:\n\n* It's an opportunity to hear from staff about their likes and wishes, which could be about their team, their department, the company in general, or on any topic. These could be likes and wishes off the top of your head, or maybe something you've been thinking about for a while. This simulates an open feedback session at MatterCon where we would ask people to share their thoughts and feelings.\n* The priority of the meeting is listening. During these sessions the CEO takes notes and refrains from commentary, though may ask follow-up questions. Notes are \"default open\" to be shared with managers, executives, and anyone in the company.\n* At the end of the session the CEO reads back what they heard. The notes are shared with the management team/s of the group.\n* It's then up to managers to decide how to process and address the feedback at the team level. The CEO can also incorporate the information at the company level.\n* In the past, participants and managers of listening tours have found the meetings productive for uncovering blindspots at the company and within departments.\n\nIf you're not able to make a particular listening meeting, please ping @amy.nicol to add you to a different slot.\n\nHow to participate in Listening Tours:\n\n1. **Join us:** Attend the scheduled meeting, or if it's not convenient, ping @amy.nicol to join a different meeting slot.\n2. **Share about yourself:** Please introduce yourself with the group \\(even if we all know each other\\), with your name, your role, the city and country you're in, and what time it is there.\n3. **Share a like and a wish:** If you'd like to share feedback, in the form of a like and a wish, please share it when you feel appropriate. Your feedback can be about anything, something recent \\(\"Wish Zoom was more stable\"\\) or something you've been thinking about or talking about for a while \\(\"Really like the Social Coffee channel and meeting people across the company\"\\).\n4. **Confirm you've been heard:** As feedback is read back, share if what you had to say has been accurately captured to be shared with our leadership team, execs, and managers.\n\nListening tours are just another way we gather feedback so we can iterate and improve everything we do. Thank you for helping speed us on our journey of continual improvement.\n\n## GNN Updates \n\nA GNN Update is a concise way to share out what's \"Going Well\", \"Not Going Well\", and \"Next Actions\" on a specific initiative or goal.\n\n- **Going Well**: What's going well, and what would we want to amplify or repeat?\n- **Not Going Well**: What's moving slower than expected? What's in our way?\n- **Next Actions**: Based on what's going well (things we want to amplify or repeat) and Not Going Well (problems we need to solve), what are the next actions we want to take in the next 1-2 weeks? Next actions should include who is responsible for them, a due date and what the expected outcomes and imapct of the next actions.\n\nIf a GNN has been shared previously, the Business owner should share the following in their next update:\n \n- **Outcomes of previous Next Actions**: Share what happened after the last set of Next Actions were shared out, good and bad. If the Next Action wasn't completed, explain why, and then what we'll do next time to complete the action.\n- **Link to previous GNN Update**: Add a link back to the previous GNN update as a reference.\n\n## Monthly Business Review (\"MBR\") \n\n- Each month we review our progress against our company-level standard operating metrics.\n- The GNN Updates are prepared by business owners with input from the data owners. \n- In the MBR we align on the most important opportunities to accelerate the company, and supporting the DRI with Next Actions across the company to bring a goal back to success.\n",

We have 1-1s with managers, regular pulse and engagement surveys, People team outreach and conversations, and annonymous feedback available in every weekly Customer Obsession/All-Hands Meeting. CEO Listening Tours are another way we listen.</p>\n<p>CEO Listening Tours happen over Zoom in meetings around 25-30 minutes with different groups of 5-8 staff, typically within the same department or in a related function. Managers of the team members in the group are typically not included in the meeting.</p>\n<p>Some notes about Listening Tours:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It's an opportunity to hear from staff about their likes and wishes, which could be about their team, their department, the company in general, or on any topic. These could be likes and wishes off the top of your head, or maybe something you've been thinking about for a while. This simulates an open feedback session at MatterCon where we would ask people to share their thoughts and feelings.</li>\n<li>The priority of the meeting is listening. During these sessions the CEO takes notes and refrains from commentary, though may ask follow-up questions. Notes are \"default open\" to be shared with managers, executives, and anyone in the company.</li>\n<li>At the end of the session the CEO reads back what they heard. The notes are shared with the management team/s of the group.</li>\n<li>It's then up to managers to decide how to process and address the feedback at the team level. The CEO can also incorporate the information at the company level.</li>\n<li>In the past, participants and managers of listening tours have found the meetings productive for uncovering blindspots at the company and within departments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're not able to make a particular listening meeting, please ping @amy.nicol to add you to a different slot.</p>\n<p>How to participate in Listening Tours:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Join us:</strong> Attend the scheduled meeting, or if it's not convenient, ping @amy.nicol to join a different meeting slot.</li>\n<li><strong>Share about yourself:</strong> Please introduce yourself with the group (even if we all know each other), with your name, your role, the city and country you're in, and what time it is there.</li>\n<li><strong>Share a like and a wish:</strong> If you'd like to share feedback, in the form of a like and a wish, please share it when you feel appropriate. Your feedback can be about anything, something recent (\"Wish Zoom was more stable\") or something you've been thinking about or talking about for a while (\"Really like the Social Coffee channel and meeting people across the company\").</li>\n<li><strong>Confirm you've been heard:</strong> As feedback is read back, share if what you had to say has been accurately captured to be shared with our leadership team, execs, and managers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Listening tours are just another way we gather feedback so we can iterate and improve everything we do. Thank you for helping speed us on our journey of continual improvement.</p>\n<h2>GNN Updates</h2>\n<p>A GNN Update is a concise way to share out what's \"Going Well\", \"Not Going Well\", and \"Next Actions\" on a specific initiative or goal.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Going Well</strong>: What's going well, and what would we want to amplify or repeat?</li>\n<li><strong>Not Going Well</strong>: What's moving slower than expected? What's in our way?</li>\n<li><strong>Next Actions</strong>: Based on what's going well (things we want to amplify or repeat) and Not Going Well (problems we need to solve), what are the next actions we want to take in the next 1-2 weeks? Next actions should include who is responsible for them, a due date and what the expected outcomes and imapct of the next actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a GNN has been shared previously, the Business owner should share the following in their next update:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Outcomes of previous Next Actions</strong>: Share what happened after the last set of Next Actions were shared out, good and bad. If the Next Action wasn't completed, explain why, and then what we'll do next time to complete the action.</li>\n<li><strong>Link to previous GNN Update</strong>: Add a link back to the previous GNN update as a reference.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Monthly Business Review (\"MBR\")</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Each month we review our progress against our company-level standard operating metrics.</li>\n<li>The GNN Updates are prepared by business owners with input from the data owners. </li>\n<li>In the MBR we align on the most important opportunities to accelerate the company, and supporting the DRI with Next Actions across the company to bring a goal back to success.</li>\n</ul>",

Some of this information may be company confidential and may\n  not be viewable.\n---\n\n# Company Operations\n\n## Company Key Info\n\n* [About Mattermost](../../company/about-mattermost/#mission) - Mission, vision, company overview, history\n* [R&D Operations](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development) - How we build software\n* [Deployment Engineering Operations](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/deployment-engineering) - How we support customer deployments\n* [Finance Operations](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance) - Procurement, spend, fiscal year infor, etc. \n* [Legal Operations](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/legal) - Approvals, processes and specialist legal support\n* [Security Operations](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/security) - Our security, privacy and policies around security research \n* [Workplace](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace) - How we work at Mattermost day-to-day\n\n## How Mattermost uses Mattermost \n\n### Channels \n\nThink of Channels like rooms in a building. Public channels are open rooms that people can enter and leave freely. Private channels are like private rooms that are invitation-only. Direct Messages are like popping your head into someone's private office to have a conversation. Group Direct Messages are like popping your head in to a shared office to have a discussion. \n\nAll channels can be used to communicated, some are better at specific use cases than others: \n\n#### Public channels\n\nFind public channels from **+ > Browse Channels** and join and leave based on your topics of interest. Use public channels for \"open door\" discussions of information relevant to everyone in the channel, for example **News and Buzz** is a channel to share updates on Mattermost being mentioned on social media and in press.\n\n#### Private channels\n\nUse private channels to collaborate on work that would benefit from privacy, and not appropriate for an \"open door\" discussion. For example, planning manager training, organizing our next MatterCon conference, procurement processes where financial data could be shared, launch planning activities (which can be fast changing and confusing if shared ahead of launch). \n\n#### Direct messages\n\nUse direct messages (or \"DMs\") to send quick notes to someone to get their attention, like \"Running late\" or \"Can you comment on this ticket? [Link]\". Avoid using DMs for collaborative work, as it's difficult to share context from a DM discussion with others--use Boards or group channels instead.\n\n#### Group direct messages\n\nUse group direct messages (or \"GDMs\") very sparingly, and ideally to send only ephemeral notes to a group like \"Running late\" or \"Please get your forecasts in by end-of-day. [Link]\". Once a GDM is sent, it can be difficult for some users to find the channel again, so it's best if it's not a store of data.\n\n### Boards\n\nThink of Boards like a project board on a giant wall, with \"Tickets\" that can contain all sorts of rich information. You can use Boards to managing any project--goals, tasks, interview candidates, SWAG projects--and organize things based on custom properties, like categories, status, dates, numbers and people. Here's some examples: \n\n- **FY23 Goals** - For MLT and MLX, we use Boards to run our [FY23 Goals process in Boards](https://community.mattermost.com/boards/workspace/8qt6sh1dzbybb8365caots67iy/b7qzfu3p11f8u9q6mkkfjer4pjr/ve8dq37s8t7baxbgn8t47mtpixe) to align the company and operations around our vision for the year. \n\n### Playbooks\n\nThink of \"Playbooks\" as a set of binder on a shelf with plans and procedures for different incidents and processes. Based on the type of incident or process, the context (e.g. time of day) Playbooks will include steps to follow, people to notify and automation to kick-off to rapidly flow through, resolve, and learn from different \"Runs\" of a Playbook. Examples include: \n\n- **Incident Response** - Join the public [`Incident Status`](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/incidents) channel to monitor incident escalations at Mattermost, which operated based on our [Incident Response Process (Internal only)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-AWQJQelgKvGVSP6sOIi9EOSVjxXVlJlwNuJlkcXKGA/edit#heading=h.uk4q4qkm81h0). \n\n### Email \n\nThink of email like a physical piece of mail you'd want to send to individuals and groups, who might forward the message to others, or reply to the original group. Examples include: \n\n- **Cascading Content** - If you're making an announcement across management layers and you want to give each layer and opportunity to add context to the message or choose the people to whom it's forwarded and decide on timing, then email is the best choice. For example, if you're announcing a \"company day off\" you want to give different managers an opportunity to customize the message as it flows through to their teams, some managers who have on-call staff might have to make accomodations (on-call people need to work, but they can choose a different day off) while another manager who's team has been working on a massive project might want to give an extra day off for their teams, etc. \n\n- **Approvals** - Written approvals that need to be circulated and archived are an excellent fit for email. Offer letter approvals are a good example, which need to flow through different HR and manager approval chains and ultimately archived in our HR systems. \n\n- **One new topic** - If you have a new topic to discuss in a small group and there's not a good public or private channel, email is an ideal way to start. Choose email over DMs and GDMs if it's an on-going conversation - but choose DMs and GDMs for urgent and ephemeral topics, e.g., \"Can you approve this thing?\" / \"The meeting invite link is broken!\", etc.\n\n### Documentation \n\nDocumentation is like the policy manual for a company. As much as possible, document things publicly. \n\n- **Product Documentation** - docs.mattermost.com - Make product documentation as public as possible. \n\n- **Operating Documentation** - handbook.mattermost.com - Document our internal processes and operations. \n\n- **Mattermost.com** - mattermost.com - Document our customer-facing information.\n",

Ideally, we have a DRI for all metrics, goals, projects, meetings, and decisions. \u201cIf something needs to get done, someone needs to do it.\u201d [Please see this document for more context on why we need DRIs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4jBy1XryEdknFoDCMUY93PEn0rR-oOOx6yiLSiaa38/edit). \n\nAt the highest level, we think about DRIs in these two contexts: \n\n## Functional or Product DRI\nThis AOR is based on an individual\u2019s role in their department. It includes what they are responsible for as part of their core job duties. Some ways we track this are [Mattermost AORs v5](https://community.mattermost.com/boards/team/qghzt68dq7bopgqamcnziq69ao/25b8db83-635b-4469-8c66-37774edbd0c5/b7d3d81e-2c25-4a6c-8937-409d538654cd), and in the handbook, like in [this example](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/organization#product).\n\nFunctional or Product DRIs typically have **decision ownership** because: \n- No one external has approval or decision authority on their AOR, only means to provide input. \n- They have an escalation path within their functional leadership to support decision-making.\n- AORs are delegated from their functional management chain, and there's a clear Exec sponsor.  \n\n## Outcome DRI\nThis AOR is based on an individual\u2019s ability to drive outcomes cross-functionally across the organization. This may include strategic initiatives or solving organizational issues. Examples include Cloud DRI, SOC2 DRI, MS Teams DRI, and Growth DRI. \n\nOutcome DRIs typically have **decision influence** because: \n- They influence the priorities of organizations outside of their direct control, which may or may not be aligned with the skillsets or priorities required to reach an outcome.  \n- They need to negotiate and escalate issues across departments to achieve agreement and commitment, with the need to escalate to an apex manager (which in some cases may be CEO). \n- They hold leaders, executives, and ICs accountable for agreements and commitments to contribute work that produces an outcome.\n\nOutcome DRIs are expected to: \n- Work cross-functionally in a manner that improves collaboration through clarity of direction, decisions, and priorities. \n- Be accountable for outcomes where control of resources is not available. Hold leaders, executives, and ICs accountable for agreements and commitments.\n- Communicate clearly and cross-organizationally to keep the company aligned on intent, progress, bottlenecks, and next actions (\"GNN\") \n\nThere may be opportunities to develop your career by being assigned the DRI of a specific organizational outcome. To be considered a candidate for a DRI of an organizational outcome, you have the following skills: \n\n- High-impact collaborator: Align people from different backgrounds and perspectives on outcomes and shared objectives.\n- Influential communicator: Effectively providing context so people can understand the issues and are compelled to contribute to the solution. \n- Stakeholder facilitation: Curate constructive idea sharing, manage an influx of information, and get stakeholders to agree on the most important actions.\n- Project management: Able to organize action steps and hold people accountable for completing tasks to progress initiatives to the outcome.\n- Empowers ownership: brings people in to be part of the solution based on what value they can bring and can increase ownership across a working group. \n",

        "content": "# Issue/Solution Proposal Process\n\nIssue/Solution Proposal (ISP) is a tool for increasing clarity, speed, and output in teams. \n\nNote: Special thanks to [Matt Mochary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-mochary-34bb4/) for the framework on which this system is based.\n\n# Decision-making\n\n## Getting buy-in\n\nOne of the core challenges in leadership is getting teams to buy into a decision intellectually and emotionally.\n\nYou create buy-in when you make people feel they're part of the decision, and that their input contributes to the final outcome. The more influence they feel they have on the outcome, the more they\u2019ll be invested in the final result.\n\nBroadly, there are three ways to make a decision. Each has a different time requirement, and creates a different level of buy-in. The methods that create the most buy-in also take the most amount of time.\n  \n### Method A: Unilateral decision\n\nFor a decision where there's a clear decision maker based on Areas of Responsibility (see Type 1 vs Type 2 below), the decision maker announces a decision to the team, and answers questions. This is typical when a decision is within someone\u2019s Area of Responsibility.\n\nExample: A digital marketer who's responsible for managing the executing of advertising campaigns using different vendors would make a Method A decision on which vendors to choose, and let others know.\n\nPros:\n- Takes very little time.\n\nCon:   \t\n- Creates very little buy-in and gets no benefit from the team\u2019s knowledge and experience.\n\n### Method B: Issue and solution proposed\n\nA decision maker creates (or assigns someone to create) a written straw man (a hypothetical answer designed to inspire discussion), shares it with the team, invites team to give feedback (written and verbal), facilitates group discussion, makes everyone feel heard by repeating back their comments, and then makes a final decision.\n\nPros:\n- Creates more buy-in. Gets some minimal benefit from the collective wisdom of the team.\n\nCon:\n- Takes more time.\n\n### Method C: Wallow on strategic issue\n\nA decision maker invites a team to a meeting where a dilemma is discussed from scratch with no straw man. The team shares ideas. The decision maker repeats back everyone\u2019s ideas until they feel heard. The decision maker shares their own idea last (because theirs is the loudest voice in the room). Lastly, decision maker makes the decision. \n\nNote that this is not a consensus decision. Buy-in is created by the decision maker confirming that they heard all ideas, not by accommodating all ideas.\n\nPros:\n- Creates the most buy-in. Gets a lot of benefit from the collective wisdom of the team.\n\nCon:\n- Takes the most time.\n \nNot surprisingly, the greatest benefits require the most work. If you want more buy-in and a better decision, you need to take more time in making the decision.\n\nSo, which method should you use? It depends on how significant the decision is, and how important buy-in is.\n\nFor everyday, low-impact issues (for example, entering a new reseller relationship), Method A is sufficient. For major, core issues (for example, Company 10-Year Vision), Method C is necessary. For everything in between (the vast majority of important decisions), Method B is optimal.\n\nFor Method B, we use the Issue/Proposed Solution method.\n\n# Issues/Solution Proposed (ISP)\n\nTeam members will often want to bring up an issue and discuss it verbally. This is both inefficient (listening takes longer than reading) and ineffective (in verbal discussions the most vocal people often have the most influence).\n\nInstead, we require that anyone who presents an issue at a team meeting do so in writing. The write-up should include both a detailed description of the Issue as well as their Proposed Solution. A team member asked to do a write-up might say \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter. They should take a guess and create a strawman. Even if they only have 10% confidence that their answer is the right one. And they should phrase the Proposed Solution in very bold, directive terms (\u201cDo this \u2026.\u201d). This may seem aggressive, but it plants a flag in the sand which generates a much more productive discussion and a quicker decision-time, which is more important than appearing to be humble.\n\nAll Issues and Proposed Solutions are presented at the weekly Team Meeting, including a pre-recording that can be replayed asynchronously at high speed to save time.\n\nAllow up to 5 minutes of discussion for each tactical (short-term) Proposed Solution and up to 20 minutes for each strategic (long-term) Proposed Solution. If in that time, the decision maker feels that they have enough context to make a decision, they announce and write the decision. The Solution is turned into one or more Next Actions with a DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) and Due Date for each.\n\nWe use an Issue/Solution Proposed (ISP) template to structure these issues, and typically include a recording of the issue so it can be explained quickly and concisely.\n\nIf the decision maker feels they don\u2019t have enough context to make a decision, DO NOT spend more time talking about the Issue. Instead turn to the RAPID decision-making framework described below.\n\n# Type 1 vs Type 2 decisions\n\nA Type 1 decision is a \u201cone-way door\u201d. Once it\u2019s made, it\u2019s very difficult to reverse. Acquiring a company, or discontinuing a product line are examples of Type 1 decisions.\n\nAs organizations get larger, there\u2019s a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making process on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention. We need to fight that tendency.\n\nEach time there is a decision to be made, rate it as Type 1 or Type 2.\n\n- Type 1 decisions should be made by the CEO.\n- Type 2 decisions should be made by someone who is not CEO, unless it impacts CEO-specific AORs.\n\nMost decisions are Type 2.\n\n# RAPID decision-making\n\nWhen a decision is complex and can\u2019t be reached efficiently even after a well-prepared ISP, we should use a RAPID framework. This is in specific cases when:\n\n- A team has become too large to easily get all of the needed voices in one room.\n- Consensus cannot be reached within 5-20 minutes of discussion.\n\nHere is an Example of a RAPID. In an Issue/Proposed Solution using RAPID:\n\n1. Someone identifies an issue or decision that needs to be made. They write up:\n\n  1. The Issue\n  2. The Proposed Solution\n  3. The list of people needed to make and implement the decision:\n      - R (Recommend) = the one who first proposed the Issue and Solution.\n      - A (Agree) = those people whose input must be incorporated in the decision. This is typically blank, unless is is the legal team to ensure no one is breaking the law. It should be very rare that anyone else's agreement is required for a decision. \n      - P (Perform) = those people who will have to enact any decision and therefore should be heard.\n      - I (Input) = those people whose input is worth considering.\n      - D (Decide) = the one who will make the decision. \n        - If Type 1, this should be the CEO.\n        - If Type 2, this should be someone other than the CEO.\n  4. A section on the document for each person above to write their comments.\n\n2. The R then reaches out to all the As, Ps, and Is to solicit their input. Once this input is received, the document is ready to be reviewed by the D. If the ISP involves an off-cycle budget change over $100K, R should work with finance team for their estimate of impact to financial plan.\n\n3. The R schedules a Decision Meeting and invites the D, As, Is, and Ps.\n\n    - If the issue is urgent, the R schedules this Decision Meeting as soon as it needs to be.\n    - If the issue is non-urgent, the R can use the next Team Meeting as the Decision Meeting. This is much more efficient, and should be done whenever the issue is non-urgent.\n\n4. At the Decision Meeting, the D reads through the document. If they have any questions, they asks them. If the questions can be fully answered in 5 minutes, they decide. If the questions can't be answered in 5 minutes, the D asks for another round of written responses on the document to answer the questions. At the next Team Meeting, the D reviews these responses, and decides.\n\n5. Once the D decides, they write up the Decision (or asks the R to do so) along with all the Next Actions (each with a DRI and Due Date). The D then publishes this decision to the company via the appropriate ticketing system and/or other channels.\n",

Writing is one way we can bring Mattermost\u2019s values to life. And above all, our voice demonstrates our deep respect for our clients and users. Ultimately, Mattermost exists because of them, so it\u2019s important we keep their needs at the forefront of our writing style.\n\nMattermost's voice is:\n\n* Clear\n* Concise\n* Consistent\n* Customer-centric\n* Professional\n\nTo achieve this, we keep the following principles in mind when writing content:\n\n* Write clearly and concisely - get to the point quickly without losing valuable information\n* Use simple, plain language that is easy to understand and family-friendly\n* Avoid jargon and overly technical terminology\n* Use direct, casual tone instead of an informal tone\n* Use the active voice\n* Write short, active sentences and maintain a visual separation between page elements\n* Focus on what the target audience wants to accomplish by being practical/outcome-focused\n* Write for an international audience without idioms or expressions that people outside of your country/region are unlikely to understand\n\nWe generally avoid the following statements and phrases as they're overused and vague:\n\n* \"Work better\"\n* \"Do better work, faster\"\n* \"Get more done in less time\"\n* \"Chat\" \\(as a stand-alone feature reference.

        "content": "# Community Response Policy\n\nThis page outlines the process for escalating sensitive topics within Mattermost.\n\n## Why do we need a policy?\n\nThere are several sensitive topics raised by the community that we want to address appropriately and consistently at all times.\n\nHowever, currently the struggles we have as a team is the unclarity on where Mattermost stands on each of the sensitive topics listed below. This unclarity often results in inconsistent responses that lead to confusion for our users, or ingenuine responses that breaks the trust from our community. We want to stop both of these from happening.\n\nThis policy is put in place to compel us as a team to have a clear official point of view for each of the listed topics below, with standard responses that can be used by a broader team. Until a clear point of view is reached, a person or a group of people are assigned as the approved responders to avoid unnecessary confusion and broken trust with our users and our community.\n\nTherefore, if you see a question on a sensitive topic, the ask is to follow the escalation process below, and escalate sensitive topics to the approved responders until an official point of view is clearly documented. Once documented, this process will be revisited.\n\nThis policy is intended to be an iterative process, and feedback is encouraged and welcome. If there are any questions about this policy, please reach out in the [Community Escalations channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/community-escalations) in Mattermost, or message @jason.blais directly.\n\n## Escalation process\n\nSensitive topics listed below are escalated to a [Community Escalations channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/community-escalations) in the Private Staff team, which includes all members of the Mattermost Leadership Team \\(MLT\\) plus any approved responders. This channel is public, so anyone in the company can escalate an issue.\n\nWhen an issue relating to a sensitive topic is raised \\(for example, on GitHub issues, Twitter, or elsewhere\\), it should be posted in the Community Escalations channel with an @-mention to the list of approved responders related to that particular issue.\n\nRaising an issue is the responsibility of whoever is managing community responses in a given forum. However, it is also open for anyone at the company to escalate an issue that they see. It is then the responsibility of the approved responders to review the issue and choose an owner for responding \\(if a response is appropriate\\). By default, ownership is delegated to the first person on the list of approved responders.\n\n## Sensitive topics\n\nWhile anyone can escalate a sensitive topic, only approved responders listed below can engage. If you\u2019d like to be an approved responder for one or more of the topics, we welcome the help! Reach out to @jason.blais on community.mattermost.com, and you will be added to the next training session.\n\n1.

It does affect Mattermost's ability to answer support requests, provide consulting services, and provide new improvements or patches to Mattermost software.\n\nAt a high level, precautions include:\n\n* DRBCP is tested, evaluated and refined annually to ensure our processes are working and up-to-date.\n* As support is the most critical service offered, multiple channels for support engagement are available and monitored, including email, a Mattermost community server available on web, desktop and mobile, online forums, online forms, social media channels \\(Twitter and Facebook\\), and for Premier Support customers, we offer a telephone-based call center.\n* Subject Matter Experts for escalations are available in at least three centers in different timezones to provide redundant coverage should communication with one or multiple centers be disrupted. Mattermost staff use a diverse set of operating systems, including Mac, Windows, and different distributions of Linux, and a diverse set of global internet service providers, to reduce the potential damage of a single strain of malware, single desktop computing exploit, or single telecommunications outage.\n* As further redundancy, we have a network of [partners](https://mattermost.com/partners/) around the world skilled in Mattermost technologies to be contacted for assistance for critical customer issues.\n* As further redundancy, we have a community of several hundred engineers around the world and over a thousand contributors to our online forums, who have sufficient access and expertise in Mattermost's open source technologies that could be contact in the highly unlikely event both Mattermost, Inc. and our partner networks are unable to service our customers.\n* As further redundancy, Mattermost provides open source code for its core server technology, mobile applications, desktop applications, and a wide array of extensions which allows customers to have transparency into the functionality of the software and solve the issue with their internal technical teams should a massive worldwide failure of Mattermost, Inc., its partners and its community arise.\n\nMattermost, Inc. is headquartered in Palo Alto, California with a distributed organization across three timezones, and is therefore not easily affected by typical causes of business disruption, such as local failures of equipment, power, telecommunications, social unrest, fire, or natural disasters. Even so, threats considered in the context of business continuity are categorized by impact of the disruption.\n\n### Priority 1: Outages that would have immediate impact on a Mattermost customer\n\n#### Key support staff unavailable in case of customer emergency.\n\n**Effect: Emergency response times exceed expectations.**\n\n**Solution\\(s\\)**\n\nLevel 1 \\(Critical Business Impact\\) and Level 2 \\(Major Business Impact\\) support requests are received by on-call support staff, as well as three supervisory staff who can monitor and escalate issues should the assigned staff member appear to be unavailable or unable to respond to the request within the SLA time allotted.\n\nAs an additional safeguard, when an L1 or L2 escalation is reported, a notification is sent via the company's internal Mattermost instance to all qualified support staff to be aware of the issue, and any member can step in if it seems follow up may not be achieved within SLA expectations.\n\n**Mitigation\\(s\\)**\n\n* Mattermost, Inc. employs support staff and engineers in multiple timezones to increase availability, reduce response times and to reduce the risk that key support staff would be unavailable to service emergency requests.\n\n#### Downtime for Mattermost Hosted Push Notification Service \\(HPNS\\)\n\n**Effect: End users at customer sites deploying on HPNS do not receive mobile push notifications.**\n\n**Solution\\(s\\)**\n\nMattermost, Inc. can re-deploy the service from backup to new infrastructure, should its existing infrastructure suffer an outage.\n\n**Mitigation\\(s\\)**\n\nHPNS is available [as open source software hosted on GitHub.com](https://github.com/mattermost/push-proxy), allowing enterprises an option to compile and self-host the service, should they choose not to use HPNS hosted by Mattermost, Inc.\n\n#### Disruption of infrastructure providing support over email, online tickets or Mattermost messaging during customer emergency\n\n**Effect: Unable to communicate with Mattermost, Inc. support team during emergency**\n\n**Solution\\(s\\)**\n\nShould a support channel be out-of-service, Mattermost, Inc. provides redundant support options through email, online ticketing, and \\(for customers who have purchased core access Premier support\\) online message via Mattermost.\n\n### Priority 2: Outages having immediate impact on business continuity\n\n#### Outage due to malicious software \\(viruses, works, trojans, and similar\\)\n\n**Effect: Reduced capacity to continue business operations, depending on attack.**\n\n**Solution\\(s\\)**\n\nMattermost, Inc. staff uses multiple anti-virus solutions for detecting and removing malicious software and regularly backs up key systems to delete infected systems and re-deploy its infrastructure. Moreover, the company uses a range of Windows, Mac, and Linux-based workstations, reducing the probability of a company wide disruption from a single strain of malicious software.\n\n#### Outage due to online attacks\n\n**Effect: Reduced capacity to continue business operations, depending on attack.**\n\n**Solution\\(s\\)**\n\nMattermost, Inc. runs multiple monitoring and alerting services to detect and isolate suspicious traffic and requests in order to minimize downtime from potential online threats.\n\nShould our self-hosted Mattermost instance be disrupted we can, if needed, quickly re-deploy the solution within our VPN.\n\n#### Disruption due to influenza pandemic or infectious disease outbreak\n\n**Effect: Reduced capacity to continue business operations.**\n\n**Solution\\(s\\)**\n\nMattermost, Inc. employs staff and engineers in multiple timezones and geographic areas, reducing the risk of significant disruption that an influenza pandemic or infectious disease outbreak would cause to business operations.\n\n### Priority 3: Outages greater than 72 hours impacting business continuity\n\n#### Outage of online CRM system\n\n**Effect: Reduced ability to continue sales operations.**\n\n**Solution\\(s\\)**\n\nWhile there is no current failover plan should our online CRM system become disrupted, we have SLAs with our CRM vendor - which is used by thousands of other organizations - and believe the probability of sustained outage is low.\n\n### Priority 4: Outages greater than 10 days impacting business continuity\n\n#### Outage of online HR and intranet systems\n\n**Effect: Reduced ability to continue HR and internal operations.**\n\n**Solution\\(s\\)**\n\nWhile there is no current failover plan should our online HR or intranet system become disrupted, we have SLAs with our vendors - which is used by thousands of other organizations - and believe the probability of sustained outage is low.\n\n",

A copy of penetration results may be requested by customers upon five (5) day written notice at any time, but no more than once per twelve (12) month period.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Business continuity plan</h2>\n<p>This document outlines Mattermost, Inc.'s <strong>Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plan (DRBCP)</strong> informed by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council guidelines on Business Continuity Planning in the context of Mattermost, Inc. being a vendor providing self-hosted software and consulting services to financial institutions.</p>\n<p>Because Mattermost software runs within a customer's data center, behind a customer's firewall and existing layers of security, without dependency to services hosted by Mattermost, the disruption of the business continuity of Mattermost, Inc. does not immediately impact the operating continuity of its customers. It does affect Mattermost's ability to answer support requests, provide consulting services, and provide new improvements or patches to Mattermost software.</p>\n<p>At a high level, precautions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DRBCP is tested, evaluated and refined annually to ensure our processes are working and up-to-date.</li>\n<li>As support is the most critical service offered, multiple channels for support engagement are available and monitored, including email, a Mattermost community server available on web, desktop and mobile, online forums, online forms, social media channels (Twitter and Facebook), and for Premier Support customers, we offer a telephone-based call center.</li>\n<li>Subject Matter Experts for escalations are available in at least three centers in different timezones to provide redundant coverage should communication with one or multiple centers be disrupted. Mattermost staff use a diverse set of operating systems, including Mac, Windows, and different distributions of Linux, and a diverse set of global internet service providers, to reduce the potential damage of a single strain of malware, single desktop computing exploit, or single telecommunications outage.</li>\n<li>As further redundancy, we have a network of <a href=\"https://mattermost.com/partners/\">partners</a> around the world skilled in Mattermost technologies to be contacted for assistance for critical customer issues.</li>\n<li>As further redundancy, we have a community of several hundred engineers around the world and over a thousand contributors to our online forums, who have sufficient access and expertise in Mattermost's open source technologies that could be contact in the highly unlikely event both Mattermost, Inc. and our partner networks are unable to service our customers.</li>\n<li>As further redundancy, Mattermost provides open source code for its core server technology, mobile applications, desktop applications, and a wide array of extensions which allows customers to have transparency into the functionality of the software and solve the issue with their internal technical teams should a massive worldwide failure of Mattermost, Inc., its partners and its community arise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mattermost, Inc. is headquartered in Palo Alto, California with a distributed organization across three timezones, and is therefore not easily affected by typical causes of business disruption, such as local failures of equipment, power, telecommunications, social unrest, fire, or natural disasters. Even so, threats considered in the context of business continuity are categorized by impact of the disruption.</p>\n<h3>Priority 1: Outages that would have immediate impact on a Mattermost customer</h3>\n<h4>Key support staff unavailable in case of customer emergency.</h4>\n<p><strong>Effect: Emergency response times exceed expectations.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Solution(s)</strong></p>\n<p>Level 1 (Critical Business Impact) and Level 2 (Major Business Impact) support requests are received by on-call support staff, as well as three supervisory staff who can monitor and escalate issues should the assigned staff member appear to be unavailable or unable to respond to the request within the SLA time allotted.</p>\n<p>As an additional safeguard, when an L1 or L2 escalation is reported, a notification is sent via the company's internal Mattermost instance to all qualified support staff to be aware of the issue, and any member can step in if it seems follow up may not be achieved within SLA expectations.</p>\n<p><strong>Mitigation(s)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mattermost, Inc. employs support staff and engineers in multiple timezones to increase availability, reduce response times and to reduce the risk that key support staff would be unavailable to service emergency requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Downtime for Mattermost Hosted Push Notification Service (HPNS)</h4>\n<p><strong>Effect: End users at customer sites deploying on HPNS do not receive mobile push notifications.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Solution(s)</strong></p>\n<p>Mattermost, Inc. can re-deploy the service from backup to new infrastructure, should its existing infrastructure suffer an outage.</p>\n<p><strong>Mitigation(s)</strong></p>\n<p>HPNS is available <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/push-proxy\">as open source software hosted on GitHub.com</a>, allowing enterprises an option to compile and self-host the service, should they choose not to use HPNS hosted by Mattermost, Inc.</p>\n<h4>Disruption of infrastructure providing support over email, online tickets or Mattermost messaging during customer emergency</h4>\n<p><strong>Effect: Unable to communicate with Mattermost, Inc. support team during emergency</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Solution(s)</strong></p>\n<p>Should a support channel be out-of-service, Mattermost, Inc. provides redundant support options through email, online ticketing, and (for customers who have purchased core access Premier support) online message via Mattermost.</p>\n<h3>Priority 2: Outages having immediate impact on business continuity</h3>\n<h4>Outage due to malicious software (viruses, works, trojans, and similar)</h4>\n<p><strong>Effect: Reduced capacity to continue business operations, depending on attack.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Solution(s)</strong></p>\n<p>Mattermost, Inc. staff uses multiple anti-virus solutions for detecting and removing malicious software and regularly backs up key systems to delete infected systems and re-deploy its infrastructure. Moreover, the company uses a range of Windows, Mac, and Linux-based workstations, reducing the probability of a company wide disruption from a single strain of malicious software.</p>\n<h4>Outage due to online attacks</h4>\n<p><strong>Effect: Reduced capacity to continue business operations, depending on attack.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Solution(s)</strong></p>\n<p>Mattermost, Inc. runs multiple monitoring and alerting services to detect and isolate suspicious traffic and requests in order to minimize downtime from potential online threats.</p>\n<p>Should our self-hosted Mattermost instance be disrupted we can, if needed, quickly re-deploy the solution within our VPN.</p>\n<h4>Disruption due to influenza pandemic or infectious disease outbreak</h4>\n<p><strong>Effect: Reduced capacity to continue business operations.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Solution(s)</strong></p>\n<p>Mattermost, Inc. employs staff and engineers in multiple timezones and geographic areas, reducing the risk of significant disruption that an influenza pandemic or infectious disease outbreak would cause to business operations.</p>\n<h3>Priority 3: Outages greater than 72 hours impacting business continuity</h3>\n<h4>Outage of online CRM system</h4>\n<p><strong>Effect: Reduced ability to continue sales operations.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Solution(s)</strong></p>\n<p>While there is no current failover plan should our online CRM system become disrupted, we have SLAs with our CRM vendor - which is used by thousands of other organizations - and believe the probability of sustained outage is low.</p>\n<h3>Priority 4: Outages greater than 10 days impacting business continuity</h3>\n<h4>Outage of online HR and intranet systems</h4>\n<p><strong>Effect: Reduced ability to continue HR and internal operations.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Solution(s)</strong></p>\n<p>While there is no current failover plan should our online HR or intranet system become disrupted, we have SLAs with our vendors - which is used by thousands of other organizations - and believe the probability of sustained outage is low.</p>",

        "content": "# Handbook Processes and Policies\n\nWelcome to the Mattermost Handbook process, policy, and onboarding section.\n\nAs a remote-first company, we rely heavily on shared knowledge. Often, that knowledge is stored in peoples' heads, on a notepad somewhere, or in a Google Doc. The purpose of the Handbook is to capture everyone's knowledge of how Mattermost works so that we can all have access to it. This means that there's no ambiguity or confusion. It also means that when new staff members join us, it's easier for them to ramp up.\n\nSo, let's get started!\n\n## Handbook-first\n\nAs we mature, a Handbook-first policy is critical. But what does this mean?\n\nHandbook-first means that when you have a new idea, a new process, an update to a process, a change in your team, etc you document it in the Handbook first. For example, when a new staff member joins us, they should be added to your team's page before their first day. Another example is if you've created a new Jira process - first document it in the Handbook and then announce it to your team/the company. This allows you to find blindspots and also means that people can go to the relevant page immediately after the announcement to read more.\n\n### How do we drive Handbook-first?\n\nGreat question. It's a team effort across the whole company, but we plan to have a secret weapon in the form of Handbook Champions.\n\n## Handbook Champions\n\nA Handbook Champion is a volunteer from a specific team/operational area who drives Handbook-first adoption and acts as a go-to in the team for Handbook questions. They also enjoy saying \"oh you can find that in the Handbook!\" and \"You should put the in the Handbook!\". They're motivated by the understanding that a single source of truth is empowering and decreases wasted time. Lastly, Handbook Champions enjoy working with their team to ensure processes, ideas, plans, and everything in between are documented in the Handbook.\n\nThe long-term goal is that Handbook Champions will have a huge impact on Mattermost by supporting constant iteration, decreasing the barrier to information, and breaking down knowledge silos.\n\n### What's expected of Handbook Champions?\n\nThe only requirements are that you're excited about the Handbook and knowledge sharing, and love knowing that you're building something indispensable.\n\nThere's no set time or output expectation - and it's completely voluntary. The idea is not to have you write or update everything yourself, but to corral your team/operational area and get them into the habit of documenting everything in the Handbook. Another aspect is sharing outstanding Help Wanted issues with your team to see where any gaps can be filled.\n\nHowever, if the Handbook is something you're passionate about:\n\n* You can take as much initiative as you want.\n* You can suggest and own new content.\n* You can help drive change and alignment if that\u2019s what you\u2019re interested in.\n\n### What do I need to do?\n\nTo put it simply, anytime someone in your team/operational area mentions a process in a meeting or asks about one, remind them that they should either document it or can find it in the Handbook. You may also be asked to review PRs before they're merged. In time, you'll find that you're reminding less, and being asked to review more... until Handbook-first becomes a company habit.\n\nOf course, if you have ideas for content that's needed or content that should be updated and you're happy to tackle some of it that's fantastic. Likewise if you have suggestions, ideas, complaints, or issues - feel free to raise them.\n\n### How do I get involved?\n\nYou can join the [Handbook Champions channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/handbook-champions), and then also update [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1emT9vTA-D61uESeQdLuFZY-dY6MNBDpyaH7z_pw6hYI/edit?usp=sharing) with your name and team/organizational area. There can be multiple champions per team.\n\n### Will there be meetings?\n\nYes. We'll sync up once every two weeks initially, for 25 minutes. This will allow us to catch up, sync up, and keep up.\n\n### Do I get a cool badge?\n\nYes! You get a Handbook Champion badge, and may also be eligible for a Contribution Champion badge, depending a number of factors. There's also swag on offer \\(of course!\\)\n\n",

This is also the basis for all commission plans starting in FY21.**_\n\n* **If term length &gt;= 1 year, Bookings = ACV**\n* **If term length &lt; 1 year, Bookings = TCV**\n* **Net New and Expansion only**\n* Why would we have deals &lt; 1 year?\n  * True-ups\n    * Customer owes MM 30K for Q1FY21\n    * Booking would be 30K on the first day of Q2 \\(May 1\\)\n  * Co-Term Renewals\n  * Ramped Deals\n    * Customer signs a 3 year deal on Feb 28, 2020. Year 1 = 50K, Year 2 = 100K, Year 3 = 150K\n    * Bookings\n      * 2/28/20: 50K\n      * 2/28/21: 100K - 50K = 50K\n      * 2/28/22: 150K - 100K = 50K\n\n### ARR \\(Annual Recurring Revenue\\)\n\n_**What the customer bought normalized for one year length and reoccurs for length of contract**_.\n\n* ARR is the value of the contracted recurring revenue of your term subscriptions normalized to a one-year period.\n* Recognized from **start to end** of contract.\n* `ARR = (Total Contract Value / (End Date - Start Date)) * 365`\n* ARR increases and decreases based on the following categories of change:\n  * New: Increase in ARR from $0 to &gt; $0 & New Logo never seen before\n    * Caused by a brand new and never before seen Account signing a contract\n  * Expansion: Increase in ARR by an Account\n    * Caused by seat increase, price increase, or product upgrade\n  * Resurrection: Increase in ARR from $0 to &gt; $0 & by a known Account\n    * Caused by an Account churning and returning to Mattermost\n  * Contraction: Decrease in ARR by an Account\n    * Caused by seat decrease, price decrease, or product downgrade\n  * Churn: Decrease in ARR from &gt; $0 to $0 by an Account\n    * Caused by an Account moving completely off of Mattermost\n\n### TCV vs. ACV vs. ARR\n\nExample:\n\n* Opportunity: [Example Opportunity](https://mattermost.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0063600000eRMmcAAG/view)\n* Close Date: 2019-05-07\n* Amount = $250\n* Start Date: 2019-06-15\n* End Date: 2022-06-14\n* Metrics Breakdown \\(see graph below\\):\n  * ACV one-time $83 in May 2019\n  * TCV one-time $250 in May 2019\n  * ARR $83 from June 2019 until June 2022\n\n## Google Analytics\n\nAll Google Analytics data in Snowflake is at a **daily** level. See [limitations](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/analytics/metrics-definitions#google-analytics-limitations).\n\n### Organic Traffic\n\n* Organic Web Traffic is the **daily** unique visitors to \\*.mattermost.org, \\*.mattermost.com who originate from non-paid sources.\n* Organic Search Traffic is the **daily** unique visitors to \\*.mattermost.org, \\*.mattermost.com who originate from an organic Google search.\n\n### Unique Pageview \\(UPV\\)\n\nA **Unique Pageview \\(UPV\\)** aggregates pageviews that are generated by the same user during the same [session](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/analytics/metrics-definitions#session). The metric combines the pageviews that are from the same person \\(a user in Google Analytics\\), on the same page, in the same [session](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/analytics/metrics-definitions#session), and counts them as one.\n\n* Unique Page Views \\(UPV\\) are calculated as the **daily** count of distinct pageviews per user per session to view a Mattermost web property webpage \\([list of web properties defined in Google Analytics Accounts](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/analytics/metrics-definitions#google-analytics-accounts)\\).\n\n### Session\n\nA **session** is a group of user interactions within a website that take place within a given time frame. A single session can contain multiple page views, events, social interactions, and ecommerce transactions. A single user can open multiple sessions. Those sessions can occur on the same day, or over several days, weeks, or months.\n\n#### Session Expiration\n\nAs soon as one session ends, there is then an opportunity to start a new session. There are two methods by which a session ends:\n\n* Time-based expiration:\n  * After 30 minutes of inactivity.\n  * At midnight.\n* Campaign change:\n  * If a user arrives via one campaign, leaves, and then comes back via a different campaign.\n\n### Google Analytics Accounts\n\n1. mattermost.com\n2. https://mattermost.com/ \\(old mattermost.com\\)\n3. mattermost.org\n4. developers.mattermost.com\n5. integrations.mattermost.com\n6. docs.mattermost.com\n7. handbook.mattermost.com\n8. licensing.mattermost.com\n9. mattermost.gitbook.io/jira-plugin\n10. pre-release.mattermost.com \\(which is old community.mattermost.com\\)\n11. mattermost.zendesk.com\n\n### Google Analytics Limitations\n\n* [Stitch](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/business-operations/data-engineering#stitch-data) is used to pull Google Analytics data into Snowflake.\n  * Stitch is only able to pull data at a daily level.\n  * Aggregating up daily level to a monthly level causes double counting of users that may have visited the site more than one time in a given month.\n\n## Hiring\n\n* WIP\n\n## Net Promoter Score \\(NPS\\)\n\n### NPS Survey\n\nMattermost NPS data is collected using an in-product survey on servers where the [User Satisfaction Survey plugin](https://docs.mattermost.com/manage/user-satisfaction-surveys.html) is enabled. Users answer the question \"How likely are you to recommend Mattermost?\" by selecting a 0-10 score and can provide additional written feedback about their experience. Selecting a score and providing feedback are optional.\n\nNet Promoter Score is computed as **\\(% Promoters - % Detractors\\)** and ranges from -100 \\(every user is a Detractor\\) to +100 \\(every user is a Promoter\\).\n\n* Promoters \\(score 9-10\\): Loyal enthusiasts who will keep buying and refer others.\n* Passives \\(score 7-8\\): Satisfied but unenthusiastic users who are vulnerable.\n* Detractors \\(score 0-6\\): Unhappy users who can damage your brand.\n\nIf users edit their response to the survey on any particular server version, only the latest rating on each server version is used for computing NPS. Test server data is also removed via the excludable servers list and by trimming any responses submitted on a server version that has not been publically available for 21 days \\(time delay before an NPS survey is triggered after a server upgrade\\).\n\nBased on the above calculation method, we can apply a time window \\(Quarterly Trailing NPS\\) and a version filter \\(NPS by Server Version\\) to represent and track the state of Mattermost NPS.\n\n### Quarterly Trailing NPS\n\n[Quarterly Trailing NPS](https://mattermost.looker.com/dashboards/147) represents the NPS score computed based on survey submissions received in the last 90 days. We target a 90 day window of NPS responses because it:\n\n1. Encompasses responses across all server versions that are currently in use by customers \\(with surveys enabled\\), meaning it is representative of the state of user experience that customers are facing today.\n2. Ensures we have a [statistically significant sample size](https://www.checkmarket.com/sample-size-calculator/) representing the [server versions currently in use](https://mattermost.looker.com/looks/203?toggle=dat,det,pik).\n3. Helps us capture week-to-week variations in NPS while being less volatile than NPS by server version given the larger sample size.\n\n### NPS by Server Version\n\n[NPS by Server Version](https://mattermost.looker.com/dashboards/147) represents the NPS score computed based on survey submissions on a specific server version. While Quarterly Trailing NPS provides a representation of the state of user experience that our customers are facing, NPS by Server Version provides a representation of the user experience offered by the product in particular releases. As such, it's used heavily by the PM team to track the success of particular product team initiatives as they ship.\n\nNPS by Server Version is a lagging metric since we need to collect a statistically significant sample size before reporting NPS for a server version. Based on historical data, ~2000 unique user responses \\(~1.5-2 months post-ship\\) are required for the NPS of a particular server version to stabilize.\n\nNPS by Server Version can be volatile since it can be affected by the upgrade cadence of heavy usage servers. We typically see a surge in responses when surveys are triggered \\(21 days after server upgrade\\) for servers with large DAU, which can impact the NPS trend for that server version. Quarterly trailing NPS is not as affected by this since the sample size is larger and responses are submitted on various server versions.\n\n### Written Response Feedback\n\nUsers can optionally submit written responses to the NPS survey. These responses are reviewed and categorized by the PM team to allow us to stack rank certain initiatives for roadmap planning based on their impact to NPS, reach and effort to design, implement and test.\n\nTo determine impact to NPS, we can:\n\n1. Segment the reponses based on written feedback from users who are detractors or passives \\(See the NPS Feedback section of the [NPS dashboard](https://mattermost.looker.com/dashboards/147)\\).\n2. Segment the responses based on the feedback category to analyze what requested product enhancements equate to the lowest NPS scores from users.\n3. View overall number of responses by feedback category.\n\n### Renewal Metrics Reporting\n\n![](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/tree/47c855f4b78d8732ae328c3ec5a2a17453061d11/operations/.gitbook/assets/renewal_metrics_handbook.png)\n\nRenewal Metrics in simple terms:\n\n* Available Renewals \\(**X**\\): Total dollar amount of licenses ending is in the Renewal Qtr\n* Renewal Rate \\(**Y%**\\): Total Won Amount \u00f7 Available Renewals where:\n  * Won Opportunity License start date falls in the Renewal Qtr\n  * Won Opportunity Product Line Type = 'Ren'\n  * Won Amount &lt;= Available Renewal Amount\n* Forecasted Renewal Rate \\(**Z%**\\): Won Amount + \\(Total Open Amount \\* Probability\\) \u00f7 Available Renewals where:\n  * Won & Open Opportunity License Start Date falls in the Renewal Qtr\n  * Won & Open Opportunity Product Line Type = 'Ren'\n  * Won & Open Amount &lt;= Available Renewal Amount\n* Target \\(**A**\\): Target Total Bookings set for the Renewal Qtr by Finance\n* Actual \\(**B**\\): Total Bookings **Won** in the Renewal Qtr where Product Line Type = 'Ren'\n* Target vs Actual aka TvA \\(**C%**\\): Actual \u00f7 Target\n\n### Renewal Target vs Actual \\(TvA\\)\n\n* Calculation: **Renewal Actual \u00f7 Renewal Target**\n* Renewal Target\n  * Target set in a given period \\(Mo, Qtr, FY\\) by Finance\n* Renewal Actual\n  * Total Bookings **Won** in a given period \\(Mo, Qtr, FY\\) where Product Line Type = 'Ren'\n\n### Renewal Rate \\(Bookings\\)\n\n* Calculation: **\u2211 Gross Renewals \u00f7 \u2211 Available Renewals**\n* Available Renewals\n  * Amount up for renewal at Account level by Qtr\n* Gross Renewals\n  * Renewal amount booked \\(up to Available Renewal Amount\\) where **License Start** is in a given Qtr\n  * Calculation: MIN\\(Available Renewals,Renewal Bookings\\)\n  * Example 1:\n    * Account: Account 1\n    * Available Renewals Q4: $100k\n    * Renewal Bookings Q4: $130k\n    * Gross Renewals Q4: $100k\n  * Example 2:\n    * Account: Account 2\n    * Available Renewals Q4: $100k\n    * Renewal Bookings Q4: $70k\n    * Gross Renewals Q4: $70k\n\n### Forecasted Renewal Rate \\(Bookings\\)\n\n* Calculation: **\\(\u2211 Gross Renewals + \u2211 Forecasted Renewals\\) \u00f7 \u2211 Available Renewals**\n* Available Renewals \\(See Above\\)\n* Gross Renewals \\(See Above\\)\n* Open Renewal Amount\n  * Renewal amount for open Opportunities where **License Start** is in a given Qtr\n* Forecasted Renewals\n  * Open Renewal Amount \\* Probability + Gross Renewal Amount \\(up to Available Renewal Amount\\)\n  * Calculation: MIN\\(Available Renewals,\\(Open Renewal Amount \\* Probability + Renewal Bookings\\)\n\n## Support Tickets\n\n### Definitions\n\n#### Ticket Status\n\n* **New**: Ticket created that has not been assigned a support agent.\n* **Waiting on customer**: The support agent asks the customer a question and is waiting for their response.\n* **Waiting on customer - Do not Close**: Checkbox on the ticket. This is used for tickets that are expected to be open for a long period of time. This stops the clock.\n  * Examples include: The customer requests that the ticket remain open after a solution is provided, the customer is on vacation, or the customer is out ill.\n* **On Hold**: The support agent reaches out to an internal team and is waiting to hear back. Internal teams include Product, Development, or Customer Success. Any ticket that is tied to a Jira ticket is placed **On Hold**.\n* **Solved**: Support agent provides a solution to the customer. A ticket remains in a **Solved** status for 48 hours before it is set to **Closed**. While the ticket is in a **Solved** status any response from the customer will reopen the ticket.\n* **Closed**: If no response is recorded after 48 hours, a ticket in a **Solved** status will automatically be set to **Closed**. Any response to the ticket after that period of time will open a new ticket.\n\n#### Ticket Level\n\n* **Level 1: Urgent Business Impact**: Urgent issue on production system preventing business operations. A large number of users are prevented from working, and no procedural workaround is available.\n* **Level 2: High Business Impact**: Major issue on the production system severely impacting business operations.\n* **Level 3: Normal Business Impact**: Moderate issue causing a partial or non-critical loss of functionality on the production system. A small number of users are affected.\n* **Level 4: Low Business Impact**: Minor issue on non-production system or question, comment, feature request, documentation issue or other non-impacting issues.\n\n#### Ticket Measures\n\n* **First reply time**: The duration between ticket creation and the first public agent reply on the ticket.\n* **Next reply time**: The duration between ticket's first reply time and next reply time, unless otherwise communicated.\n\n**SLAs**\n\n**First Reply Time - Premium and E20 only**\n\n**Premium**\n\n* L1 \\(Urgent\\) - 1 hour\n* L2 \\(High\\) - 2 hours\n* L3 \\(Normal\\) - 8 hours\n* L4 \\(Low\\) - 24 hours\n\n**E20**\n\n* L1 \\(Urgent\\) - 4 hours\n* L2 \\(High\\) - 8 hours\n* L3 \\(Normal\\) - 24 hours\n* L4 \\(Low\\) - next business day\n\n**Next Reply Time - Premium and E20 only**\n\n**Premium**\n\n* L1 \\(Urgent\\) - 2 hours\n* L2 \\(High\\) - 4 hours\n* L3 \\(Normal\\) - 24 hours\n* L4 \\(Low\\) - 24 hours\n\n**E20**\n\n* L1 \\(Normal\\) - 4 hours\n* L2 \\(High\\) - 8 hours\n* L3 \\(Normal\\) - 24 hours\n* L4 \\(Low\\) - 24 hours\n\n**CSAT**\n\nCSAT stands for _Customer Satisfaction Rating_. 24 hours after the ticket is set to closed, the end-user receives an email asking them to rate their experience. In the email the end-user is presented with the question \"How would you rate the support you received?\". Below the question is the option to select \"Good, I'm satisfied\" or \"Bad, I'm unsatisfied\" with the option to leave a comment about their experience.\n\n**CSAT Formula**\n\nGood, I'm Satisfied / Good I'm Satisfied + Bad I'm Unsatisfied\n\n## Active Servers \\(TES, TEDAS, and TEDAU\\)\n\n### TES\n\nTES stands for _Telemetry-Enabled Servers_. It is the count of unique, [production servers](metrics-definitions.md#server-considerations) sending telemetry \\(\u201cactivity\"\\) data to Mattermost on a given date. Each component of TES can be described as follows:\n\n* Telemetry Enabled:\n  * Servers have \u201cError Reporting and Diagnostics\u201d or \u201cSecurity Alert\u201d enabled in System Console.\n  * Response to Mattermost's call to collect telemetry data recorded on a given date.\n    * For a server to respond, it must be online and telemetry enabled.\n* Servers:\n  * Servers host Mattermost instances for teams and organizations.\n  * Each team/organization can have one-to-many servers installed to host their instance.\n    * Small/Medium teams typically leverage a single server.\n    * Large teams can leverage Enterprise Edition features to create server clusters that allow them to scale their instance.\n\n#### TEDAS\n\nTEDAS stands for _Telemetry-Enabled Daily Active Servers_. It is the count of unique [production servers](metrics-definitions.md#server-considerations) sending telemetry \\(\u201cactivity\"\\) data to Mattermost on a given date **with at least one daily active user**.\n\nA server is considered to have a daily active user, if at least one user recorded activity on the Mattermost server, such as viewed a channel or posted a message, in the last 24 hours.\n\n#### TEMAS\n\nTEMAS stands for _Telemetry-Enabled Monthly Active Servers_. It is the count of unique [production servers](metrics-definitions.md#server-considerations) sending telemetry \\(\u201cactivity\"\\) data to Mattermost on a given date **with at least one monthly active user**.\n\nA server has a monthly active user, if at least one user recorded activity on the Mattermost server in the last 30 days, such as viewed a channel or posted a message.\n\nNote that an update to the metric is considered to only consider activity in the last 28 days to remove weekday variation. However, this change would require in-product changes and thus has not yet been prioritized.\n\n#### TES: Additional Metric Considerations\n\nThere are several ways to view the TEDAS metric, and there are several more ways to create metrics that are derivatives of TEDAS. Below are some of the ways to view, pivot, and/or filter the TEDAS metric to gather additional insights regarding the overall health of the business:\n\n* [TEDAS by First Telemetry-Enabled Date](https://mattermost.looker.com/looks/140):\n  * Provides the count of Telemetry-Enabled Servers trended by their first telemetry active date.\n  * Is an indicator of how many New, Telemetry-Enabled Production Servers are being stood up on any given date, week, month, year, etc. throughout the history of Mattermost.\n* [TEDAS &gt;= 7 Days Old w/ Active Users](https://mattermost.looker.com/looks/141):\n  * The count of Telemetry-Enabled Servers that are &gt;= 7 days old since their first telemetry active date w/ &gt;= 1 active user logged on the server.\n* [TEDAS Churn Rate](https://mattermost.looker.com/looks/142):\n  * The rate \\(percentage\\) at which Telemetry-Enabled Servers leave the platform \\(churn\\) or disable telemetry within a given number of days since the server's first telemetry active date.\n  * Typically \\(as of 4/15/20\\), 75-80% of new, Telemetry-Enabled Servers churn within the first 7 days of their first telemetry active date.\n\n#### Server Considerations\n\nTES only measures the count of active production servers. The Mattermost.server\\_daily\\_details table is used to calculate TES and only contains production servers. Mattermost.server\\_daily\\_details is derived from the `Events.security` table.\n\nThe `Events.security` table logs all server responses to Mattermost's call to collect telemetry data. The Server type responses include test, development, and production servers. Conditional logic is used to filter out non-production servers from the `Events.security` table and insert them into the Mattermost.server\\_daily\\_details table.\n\n* Logic to identify production servers within the `Events.security` table is as follows:\n  * Mattermost Version matching recognized format\n    * `version LIKE '_.%._._.%._'`\n    * Other version formats are not valid because they indicate a test, development, or custom built instance.\n  * No \"Dev Builds\" and \"Ran Tests\" recorded\n    * `dev_build = 0`\n    * `ran_tests = 0`\n  * Registered Users &gt;= Active Users\n    * `user_count >= active_user_count`\n    * Data anomalies occur causing servers to show  active users &gt; provisioned users - these servers must be excluded.\n\n**Non-production servers**\n\nNon-production servers are not included in TES calculations. Test and development servers are non-production servers that can be spun up for testing and various other use cases.\n\n**Server Age**\n\nThe age of a server is determined by the server's first active date. This is the minimum date a response to Mattermost's call to collect telemetry data is recorded. It can be thought of as the server's first recorded telemetry-enabled date -i.e. first active date. The age of the server is calculated as a function of this date. It is the days between the server's first active date, discussed above, and the current date \\(or other relative date being used as a comparison to calculate server age at any point throughout its lifetime\\).\n\n* Server Age = Current Date - Server First Active Date\n\n#### TES, TEDAS and TEMAS Caveats\n\nThere are additional data quality issues within the `Events.security` table that need to be addressed before inserting the verified production servers and calculating TES, TEDAS or TEMAS. The `Events.security` table is supposed to contain 1 record per server per day. This is not always the case: ~2% of server IDs have multiple rows per day. To select a single record per production server we must:\n\n* Identify the row per production server containing the maximum number of active users on the given date.\n  * If the maximum number of active users = 0 then we select the most recently logged row based on the \"hour\" field value.\n\n### TEDAU\n\nTEDAU stands for _Telemetry-Enabled Daily Active Users_. It is a metric that takes the rolling 7-day average of the sum of all \"Active Users\" logged by [telemetry-enabled production servers](metrics-definitions.md#tedas) on a given date. The TEDAU calculation sums the active\\_user\\_count column in the Mattermost.server\\_daily\\_details table, and then averages that value over the last 7 days.\n\n#### TEDAU Events\n\nCurrently only a subset of possible events, dubbed \"whitelist\" events, count towards TEDAU. The reason only a subset of events are captured is a result of exceeding Segment's \\(third-party event logging service\\) row limit. In the future, event logging will transition to Rudder \\(another third-party event logging service\\), and the list of events that count towards TEDAU will become more expansive.\n\nDeactivating a user in Mattermost will result in TEDAU decreasing, as deactivated users are filtered out of the statistic's query. However, reactivating a user in Mattermost will increase the TEDAU statistic.\n\n#### TEDAU Caveats\n\nTEDAU is the rolling 7-day average sum of active users for only verified production servers that are telemetry-enabled \\(described in [this TEDAS section](metrics-definitions.md#server-considerations)\\). All other servers, and their active user counts, are ignored as they represent testing, dev, and one-off user case environments that skew the results.\n\n**Telemetry-Enabled Active Users vs. TEDAU Metric**\n\nThe distinction between an individual server's Telemetry-Enabled Active Users and the TEDAU metric is important to note. Telemetry-Enabled Active Users are the collection of users hosted by a telemetry-enabled production server, that have visited the Mattermost site in the last 24 hours. The TEDAU metric is the rolling 7-day average sum of these users across all servers.\n\n### Server Activations\n\nA **Server Activation** is defined as the first date a production server sends telemetry data to Mattermost. In order to send telemetry data to Mattermost, a production server must be set up and activated by the end user. When a production server is first activated its telemetry feature is automatically enabled, which sends security diagnostics information to Mattermost via Segment \\(soon transitioning to Rudder\\). The server will continue to send this information on a daily basis until this telemetry feature is disabled by a Mattermost System Admin. A server activation is only captured and counted on the first telemetry-enabled date associated with a specific server.\n\n### Monthly Active Users\n\n**Monthly Active Users \\(MAU\\)** are users that have performed an event on or within 30 days of a given date. User events are triggered when a user interacts with the Mattermost platform from their desktop or mobile device. After a user performs an event, that user will remain in MAU for 30 days. After that time the user will fall out of MAU and be classified as \"Disengaged\".\n\n#### MAU Engagement Lifecycle Segments\n\nMonthly active users are categorized into **Engagement Lifecycle Segments**. There are five engagement lifecycle segments: \"Persisted\", \"First-Time Active\", \"Reengaged\", \"Newly Disengaged\", and \"Disengaged\". Each segment is derived from the timeline from when a user performs an event. Each Engagement Lifecycle Segment is defined as follows:\n\n* **First-Time Active**: The first time a user performs an event on the Mattermost platform and is classified as a MAU.\n* **Reengaged**: A user performs an event for the first time after &gt;= 31 days of inactivity on the Mattermost platform.\n* **Persisted**: A user that performed an event in the last 30 days that does not fall into \"First-Time Active\" or \"Reengaged\" MAU Engagement Lifecyle Segments.\n* **Newly Disgengaged**: A user, that was previously in MAU, that has not performed an event within 30 days of their last event. A user is only \"Newly Disengaged\" on the 31st day of inactivity.\n* **Disengaged**: A user, that was previously in MAU, that has not performed an event &gt; 31 days of their last event. A \"Newly Disengaged\" user becomes \"Disengaged\" on their 32nd+ day of inactivity.\n\n#### MAU Considerations\n\n### Server Retention\n\nServer retention is calculated as Day N retention, which shows the percent of users who return to the app on a specified day after their first launch.\n\nWe do not use rolling retention, which shows the percentage of users who return to the app on a specified day or any day after that.

Users answer the question \"How likely are you to recommend Mattermost?\" by selecting a 0-10 score and can provide additional written feedback about their experience. Selecting a score and providing feedback are optional.</p>\n<p>Net Promoter Score is computed as <strong>(% Promoters - % Detractors)</strong> and ranges from -100 (every user is a Detractor) to +100 (every user is a Promoter).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promoters (score 9-10): Loyal enthusiasts who will keep buying and refer others.</li>\n<li>Passives (score 7-8): Satisfied but unenthusiastic users who are vulnerable.</li>\n<li>Detractors (score 0-6): Unhappy users who can damage your brand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If users edit their response to the survey on any particular server version, only the latest rating on each server version is used for computing NPS. Test server data is also removed via the excludable servers list and by trimming any responses submitted on a server version that has not been publically available for 21 days (time delay before an NPS survey is triggered after a server upgrade).</p>\n<p>Based on the above calculation method, we can apply a time window (Quarterly Trailing NPS) and a version filter (NPS by Server Version) to represent and track the state of Mattermost NPS.</p>\n<h3>Quarterly Trailing NPS</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://mattermost.looker.com/dashboards/147\">Quarterly Trailing NPS</a> represents the NPS score computed based on survey submissions received in the last 90 days. We target a 90 day window of NPS responses because it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Encompasses responses across all server versions that are currently in use by customers (with surveys enabled), meaning it is representative of the state of user experience that customers are facing today.</li>\n<li>Ensures we have a <a href=\"https://www.checkmarket.com/sample-size-calculator/\">statistically significant sample size</a> representing the <a href=\"https://mattermost.looker.com/looks/203?toggle=dat,det,pik\">server versions currently in use</a>.</li>\n<li>Helps us capture week-to-week variations in NPS while being less volatile than NPS by server version given the larger sample size.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>NPS by Server Version</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://mattermost.looker.com/dashboards/147\">NPS by Server Version</a> represents the NPS score computed based on survey submissions on a specific server version. While Quarterly Trailing NPS provides a representation of the state of user experience that our customers are facing, NPS by Server Version provides a representation of the user experience offered by the product in particular releases. As such, it's used heavily by the PM team to track the success of particular product team initiatives as they ship.</p>\n<p>NPS by Server Version is a lagging metric since we need to collect a statistically significant sample size before reporting NPS for a server version. Based on historical data, ~2000 unique user responses (~1.5-2 months post-ship) are required for the NPS of a particular server version to stabilize.</p>\n<p>NPS by Server Version can be volatile since it can be affected by the upgrade cadence of heavy usage servers. We typically see a surge in responses when surveys are triggered (21 days after server upgrade) for servers with large DAU, which can impact the NPS trend for that server version. Quarterly trailing NPS is not as affected by this since the sample size is larger and responses are submitted on various server versions.</p>\n<h3>Written Response Feedback</h3>\n<p>Users can optionally submit written responses to the NPS survey. These responses are reviewed and categorized by the PM team to allow us to stack rank certain initiatives for roadmap planning based on their impact to NPS, reach and effort to design, implement and test.</p>\n<p>To determine impact to NPS, we can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Segment the reponses based on written feedback from users who are detractors or passives (See the NPS Feedback section of the <a href=\"https://mattermost.looker.com/dashboards/147\">NPS dashboard</a>).</li>\n<li>Segment the responses based on the feedback category to analyze what requested product enhancements equate to the lowest NPS scores from users.</li>\n<li>View overall number of responses by feedback category.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Renewal Metrics Reporting</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/tree/47c855f4b78d8732ae328c3ec5a2a17453061d11/operations/.gitbook/assets/renewal_metrics_handbook.png\" /></p>\n<p>Renewal Metrics in simple terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Available Renewals (<strong>X</strong>): Total dollar amount of licenses ending is in the Renewal Qtr</li>\n<li>Renewal Rate (<strong>Y%</strong>): Total Won Amount \u00f7 Available Renewals where:</li>\n<li>Won Opportunity License start date falls in the Renewal Qtr</li>\n<li>Won Opportunity Product Line Type = 'Ren'</li>\n<li>Won Amount &lt;= Available Renewal Amount</li>\n<li>Forecasted Renewal Rate (<strong>Z%</strong>): Won Amount + (Total Open Amount * Probability) \u00f7 Available Renewals where:</li>\n<li>Won &amp; Open Opportunity License Start Date falls in the Renewal Qtr</li>\n<li>Won &amp; Open Opportunity Product Line Type = 'Ren'</li>\n<li>Won &amp; Open Amount &lt;= Available Renewal Amount</li>\n<li>Target (<strong>A</strong>): Target Total Bookings set for the Renewal Qtr by Finance</li>\n<li>Actual (<strong>B</strong>): Total Bookings <strong>Won</strong> in the Renewal Qtr where Product Line Type = 'Ren'</li>\n<li>Target vs Actual aka TvA (<strong>C%</strong>): Actual \u00f7 Target</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Renewal Target vs Actual (TvA)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Calculation: <strong>Renewal Actual \u00f7 Renewal Target</strong></li>\n<li>Renewal Target</li>\n<li>Target set in a given period (Mo, Qtr, FY) by Finance</li>\n<li>Renewal Actual</li>\n<li>Total Bookings <strong>Won</strong> in a given period (Mo, Qtr, FY) where Product Line Type = 'Ren'</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Renewal Rate (Bookings)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Calculation: <strong>\u2211 Gross Renewals \u00f7 \u2211 Available Renewals</strong></li>\n<li>Available Renewals</li>\n<li>Amount up for renewal at Account level by Qtr</li>\n<li>Gross Renewals</li>\n<li>Renewal amount booked (up to Available Renewal Amount) where <strong>License Start</strong> is in a given Qtr</li>\n<li>Calculation: MIN(Available Renewals,Renewal Bookings)</li>\n<li>Example 1:<ul>\n<li>Account: Account 1</li>\n<li>Available Renewals Q4: $100k</li>\n<li>Renewal Bookings Q4: $130k</li>\n<li>Gross Renewals Q4: $100k</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Example 2:<ul>\n<li>Account: Account 2</li>\n<li>Available Renewals Q4: $100k</li>\n<li>Renewal Bookings Q4: $70k</li>\n<li>Gross Renewals Q4: $70k</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Forecasted Renewal Rate (Bookings)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Calculation: <strong>(\u2211 Gross Renewals + \u2211 Forecasted Renewals) \u00f7 \u2211 Available Renewals</strong></li>\n<li>Available Renewals (See Above)</li>\n<li>Gross Renewals (See Above)</li>\n<li>Open Renewal Amount</li>\n<li>Renewal amount for open Opportunities where <strong>License Start</strong> is in a given Qtr</li>\n<li>Forecasted Renewals</li>\n<li>Open Renewal Amount * Probability + Gross Renewal Amount (up to Available Renewal Amount)</li>\n<li>Calculation: MIN(Available Renewals,(Open Renewal Amount * Probability + Renewal Bookings)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Support Tickets</h2>\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\n<h4>Ticket Status</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New</strong>: Ticket created that has not been assigned a support agent.</li>\n<li><strong>Waiting on customer</strong>: The support agent asks the customer a question and is waiting for their response.</li>\n<li><strong>Waiting on customer - Do not Close</strong>: Checkbox on the ticket.

It is the count of unique, <a href=\"metrics-definitions.md#server-considerations\">production servers</a> sending telemetry (\u201cactivity\") data to Mattermost on a given date. Each component of TES can be described as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Telemetry Enabled:</li>\n<li>Servers have \u201cError Reporting and Diagnostics\u201d or \u201cSecurity Alert\u201d enabled in System Console.</li>\n<li>Response to Mattermost's call to collect telemetry data recorded on a given date.<ul>\n<li>For a server to respond, it must be online and telemetry enabled.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Servers:</li>\n<li>Servers host Mattermost instances for teams and organizations.</li>\n<li>Each team/organization can have one-to-many servers installed to host their instance.<ul>\n<li>Small/Medium teams typically leverage a single server.</li>\n<li>Large teams can leverage Enterprise Edition features to create server clusters that allow them to scale their instance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>TEDAS</h4>\n<p>TEDAS stands for <em>Telemetry-Enabled Daily Active Servers</em>. It is the count of unique <a href=\"metrics-definitions.md#server-considerations\">production servers</a> sending telemetry (\u201cactivity\") data to Mattermost on a given date <strong>with at least one daily active user</strong>.</p>\n<p>A server is considered to have a daily active user, if at least one user recorded activity on the Mattermost server, such as viewed a channel or posted a message, in the last 24 hours.</p>\n<h4>TEMAS</h4>\n<p>TEMAS stands for <em>Telemetry-Enabled Monthly Active Servers</em>. It is the count of unique <a href=\"metrics-definitions.md#server-considerations\">production servers</a> sending telemetry (\u201cactivity\") data to Mattermost on a given date <strong>with at least one monthly active user</strong>.</p>\n<p>A server has a monthly active user, if at least one user recorded activity on the Mattermost server in the last 30 days, such as viewed a channel or posted a message.</p>\n<p>Note that an update to the metric is considered to only consider activity in the last 28 days to remove weekday variation. However, this change would require in-product changes and thus has not yet been prioritized.</p>\n<h4>TES: Additional Metric Considerations</h4>\n<p>There are several ways to view the TEDAS metric, and there are several more ways to create metrics that are derivatives of TEDAS. Below are some of the ways to view, pivot, and/or filter the TEDAS metric to gather additional insights regarding the overall health of the business:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mattermost.looker.com/looks/140\">TEDAS by First Telemetry-Enabled Date</a>:</li>\n<li>Provides the count of Telemetry-Enabled Servers trended by their first telemetry active date.</li>\n<li>Is an indicator of how many New, Telemetry-Enabled Production Servers are being stood up on any given date, week, month, year, etc. throughout the history of Mattermost.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mattermost.looker.com/looks/141\">TEDAS &gt;= 7 Days Old w/ Active Users</a>:</li>\n<li>The count of Telemetry-Enabled Servers that are &gt;= 7 days old since their first telemetry active date w/ &gt;= 1 active user logged on the server.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mattermost.looker.com/looks/142\">TEDAS Churn Rate</a>:</li>\n<li>The rate (percentage) at which Telemetry-Enabled Servers leave the platform (churn) or disable telemetry within a given number of days since the server's first telemetry active date.</li>\n<li>Typically (as of 4/15/20), 75-80% of new, Telemetry-Enabled Servers churn within the first 7 days of their first telemetry active date.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Server Considerations</h4>\n<p>TES only measures the count of active production servers. The Mattermost.server_daily_details table is used to calculate TES and only contains production servers. Mattermost.server_daily_details is derived from the <code>Events.security</code> table.</p>\n<p>The <code>Events.security</code> table logs all server responses to Mattermost's call to collect telemetry data. The Server type responses include test, development, and production servers. Conditional logic is used to filter out non-production servers from the <code>Events.security</code> table and insert them into the Mattermost.server_daily_details table.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Logic to identify production servers within the <code>Events.security</code> table is as follows:</li>\n<li>Mattermost Version matching recognized format<ul>\n<li><code>version LIKE '_.%._._.%._'</code></li>\n<li>Other version formats are not valid because they indicate a test, development, or custom built instance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>No \"Dev Builds\" and \"Ran Tests\" recorded<ul>\n<li><code>dev_build = 0</code></li>\n<li><code>ran_tests = 0</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Registered Users &gt;= Active Users<ul>\n<li><code>user_count &gt;= active_user_count</code></li>\n<li>Data anomalies occur causing servers to show  active users &gt; provisioned users - these servers must be excluded.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Non-production servers</strong></p>\n<p>Non-production servers are not included in TES calculations. Test and development servers are non-production servers that can be spun up for testing and various other use cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Server Age</strong></p>\n<p>The age of a server is determined by the server's first active date. This is the minimum date a response to Mattermost's call to collect telemetry data is recorded. It can be thought of as the server's first recorded telemetry-enabled date -i.e. first active date. The age of the server is calculated as a function of this date. It is the days between the server's first active date, discussed above, and the current date (or other relative date being used as a comparison to calculate server age at any point throughout its lifetime).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Server Age = Current Date - Server First Active Date</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>TES, TEDAS and TEMAS Caveats</h4>\n<p>There are additional data quality issues within the <code>Events.security</code> table that need to be addressed before inserting the verified production servers and calculating TES, TEDAS or TEMAS. The <code>Events.security</code> table is supposed to contain 1 record per server per day. This is not always the case: ~2% of server IDs have multiple rows per day. To select a single record per production server we must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the row per production server containing the maximum number of active users on the given date.</li>\n<li>If the maximum number of active users = 0 then we select the most recently logged row based on the \"hour\" field value.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>TEDAU</h3>\n<p>TEDAU stands for <em>Telemetry-Enabled Daily Active Users</em>. It is a metric that takes the rolling 7-day average of the sum of all \"Active Users\" logged by <a href=\"metrics-definitions.md#tedas\">telemetry-enabled production servers</a> on a given date. The TEDAU calculation sums the active_user_count column in the Mattermost.server_daily_details table, and then averages that value over the last 7 days.</p>\n<h4>TEDAU Events</h4>\n<p>Currently only a subset of possible events, dubbed \"whitelist\" events, count towards TEDAU. The reason only a subset of events are captured is a result of exceeding Segment's (third-party event logging service) row limit. In the future, event logging will transition to Rudder (another third-party event logging service), and the list of events that count towards TEDAU will become more expansive.</p>\n<p>Deactivating a user in Mattermost will result in TEDAU decreasing, as deactivated users are filtered out of the statistic's query. However, reactivating a user in Mattermost will increase the TEDAU statistic.</p>\n<h4>TEDAU Caveats</h4>\n<p>TEDAU is the rolling 7-day average sum of active users for only verified production servers that are telemetry-enabled (described in <a href=\"metrics-definitions.md#server-considerations\">this TEDAS section</a>). All other servers, and their active user counts, are ignored as they represent testing, dev, and one-off user case environments that skew the results.</p>\n<p><strong>Telemetry-Enabled Active Users vs. TEDAU Metric</strong></p>\n<p>The distinction between an individual server's Telemetry-Enabled Active Users and the TEDAU metric is important to note. Telemetry-Enabled Active Users are the collection of users hosted by a telemetry-enabled production server, that have visited the Mattermost site in the last 24 hours. The TEDAU metric is the rolling 7-day average sum of these users across all servers.</p>\n<h3>Server Activations</h3>\n<p>A <strong>Server Activation</strong> is defined as the first date a production server sends telemetry data to Mattermost. In order to send telemetry data to Mattermost, a production server must be set up and activated by the end user. When a production server is first activated its telemetry feature is automatically enabled, which sends security diagnostics information to Mattermost via Segment (soon transitioning to Rudder). The server will continue to send this information on a daily basis until this telemetry feature is disabled by a Mattermost System Admin. A server activation is only captured and counted on the first telemetry-enabled date associated with a specific server.</p>\n<h3>Monthly Active Users</h3>\n<p><strong>Monthly Active Users (MAU)</strong> are users that have performed an event on or within 30 days of a given date. User events are triggered when a user interacts with the Mattermost platform from their desktop or mobile device. After a user performs an event, that user will remain in MAU for 30 days. After that time the user will fall out of MAU and be classified as \"Disengaged\".</p>\n<h4>MAU Engagement Lifecycle Segments</h4>\n<p>Monthly active users are categorized into <strong>Engagement Lifecycle Segments</strong>. There are five engagement lifecycle segments: \"Persisted\", \"First-Time Active\", \"Reengaged\", \"Newly Disengaged\", and \"Disengaged\". Each segment is derived from the timeline from when a user performs an event. Each Engagement Lifecycle Segment is defined as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>First-Time Active</strong>: The first time a user performs an event on the Mattermost platform and is classified as a MAU.</li>\n<li><strong>Reengaged</strong>: A user performs an event for the first time after &gt;= 31 days of inactivity on the Mattermost platform.</li>\n<li><strong>Persisted</strong>: A user that performed an event in the last 30 days that does not fall into \"First-Time Active\" or \"Reengaged\" MAU Engagement Lifecyle Segments.</li>\n<li><strong>Newly Disgengaged</strong>: A user, that was previously in MAU, that has not performed an event within 30 days of their last event. A user is only \"Newly Disengaged\" on the 31st day of inactivity.</li>\n<li><strong>Disengaged</strong>: A user, that was previously in MAU, that has not performed an event &gt; 31 days of their last event. A \"Newly Disengaged\" user becomes \"Disengaged\" on their 32nd+ day of inactivity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>MAU Considerations</h4>\n<h3>Server Retention</h3>\n<p>Server retention is calculated as Day N retention, which shows the percent of users who return to the app on a specified day after their first launch.</p>\n<p>We do not use rolling retention, which shows the percentage of users who return to the app on a specified day or any day after that. The reason is that rolling retention continues to increase as days go by (someone who comes back to the app on day 31 will count towards day 1, day 2, up to day 31 retention).</p>\n<p>For concrete examples, a server is included in:\n - day 1 retention, if there is activity 24-48 hours after server creation\n - day 7 retention, if there is activity 168-192 hours after server creation\n - day 14 retention, if there is activity 336-360 hours after server creation\n - day 28 retention, if there is activity 672-696 hours after server creation</p>\n<h2>Trials</h2>\n<h3>Trial Requests</h3>\n<p><strong>All Trial Requests</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of trial license requests via <a href=\"https://mattermost.com/trial\">https://mattermost.com/trial</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Enterprise Trial Requests</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of trial license requests via <a href=\"https://mattermost.com/trial\">https://mattermost.com/trial</a> from Named Accounts or Enterprises with 5,000+ employees, in America, EMEA, Australia, or Japan.</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "# Budget\n\n## On Cycle Budget Approval\n\nThe Mattermost Finance Team prepares and reviews budgets by department annually. This process commences on January 1st with final approval made by the Board of Directors \\(BOD\\) during the first scheduled BOD meeting of the new fiscal year, usually taking place in the first quarter.\n\nDue to sensitivity of budgets, only MLT has visibility into their budgets for the departments they oversee. If you are uncertain if your vendor spending is approved in the budget, you can either reach out to your MLT member or Finance at spend@mattermost.com.\n\nSpend that is already approved should follow the [Procurement Process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-purchase/how-to-procure-a-vendor-contract) by submitting a [purchase order in Accrualify](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/spending-company-money/how-to-use-accrualify/how-to-submit-a-po).\n\n## Off Cycle Budget Approval\n\nSpending that is in addition to what was approved by the Board of Directors for the fiscal year is considered off cycle and would need to be reviewed separately. Below are the steps to follow to request additional spend.\n\n### Step 1: Functional Approval\n\nDifferent levels of functional approval are required depending on the amount of spend requested. The thresholds defined in the [Authorization Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fDIMiO0uydB_1zCUxZ4sGfSnBJ0P_49zbeQGgTqbYPI/edit?usp=sharing) indicates which team member\\(s\\) is required to approve. Spend approval should be looked at holistically and not by the vendor.\n\nFor example, SOC-2 compliance initiative requires a compliance software for 40,000 USD; an annual audit for 20,000 USD; and a consulting assessment framework for 50,000 USD. Individually, each is below the CEO functional approval threshold of 100,000 USD but in aggregate, is not. If you encounter a similar scenario, the appropriate functional approval would be the CEO.\n\n#### Requesting Functional Approval\n\nIt's best practice that you and your manager are aligned on any off cycle spend before seeking functional approval to avoid [decking](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms#decking). When requesting functional approval, an email request should be sent to the approver that is most aligned with your department, and spend@mattermost.com should be CC\u2019d with the following details at minimum included in the email. Depending on the request, it may be appropriate to expand and provide additional context like an [ISP](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-processes/issue-solution) or Google doc to make your case.\n\n**Subject:** The subject of the email should include the purpose, department making the request, and total requested spend amount. Example: _Off Cycle Spend Request\\_Security\\_50,000\\_USD_.\n\n**Body of Email:**\n\n* _Name of the vendor\\(s\\)/supplier\\(s\\)_\n* _Purpose of the request_\n* _Rationale_ - Questions you should be able to answer succinctly include:\n  * Why is this spend needed?\n  * Does this replace an existing service or software?\n  * What does spend accomplish that current spend does not?\n  * How does this align with your V2MOM and company wide objectives?\n* _Amount requesting_ - The request should be for annual spend and not fiscal year spend as we will, at minimum, have a three-year running forecast\n* _Type of program spend_ - Software, contractor, agency, consulting, etc.\n* _Period of expected spend_ - One time or ongoing, and for how long?\n\nIf the functional approver agrees with the need and spend, they should **Reply All** in the email indicating they have reviewed and are aligned with the budget needs.\n\n### Step 2: Financial Approval\n\nFinancial approval is the next step once all the functional approvals have signed off. The Finance Team assesses the requested spend against company objectives and financial targets. The following items listed below are several areas of review that are consider during the financial approval process:\n\n* Program spend creep\n* Cash burn impact\n* Business metrics \\(e.g. Magic number, CAC, LTV, net loss, fully burdened costs, etc.\\)\n* Use case: Does it require cross-functional support and use or is the spend specific to a subgroup of staff members and/or department\n\nFinancial decisions may take up to 48 hours once the functional approval has been obtained. Missing information as part of the functional approval step may delay a decision or deny approval.\n\n#### Approved Spend\n\nFinance approvals will follow the [Authorization Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fDIMiO0uydB_1zCUxZ4sGfSnBJ0P_49zbeQGgTqbYPI/edit?usp=sharing). Each Finance approver will **Reply All** to the email with the word `approved`. Once all finance approvals are obtained, your off cycle financial request is successfully completed.\n\nAt that time, follow the [Procurement Process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-purchase/how-to-procure-a-vendor-contract) to submit a purchase order request form along with your off cycle spend request documentation.\n\n#### Denied Spend\n\nBy seeking either functional or financial approval, spend does not automatically mean your request will be approved. Rather, this process is to create a repeatable and concise format to quickly and effectively make decisive budget decisions on the needs and impacts of the business.\n\nIn some instances, the Finance Team may require further details before making a decision. In that case, the Finance Team will **Reply All** via the email thread. Due to many external and complex factors, the Finance Team may not be able to approve your spend request at said time. Any denied decision will include an explanation.\n\n",

When assessing if the form should be completed, please ask yourself the following questions:\n\n* Am I trying to purchase a new product or service on behalf of Mattermost?\n* Is this a purchase not covered in [How to spend company money](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money)?\n* Is this in my budget for the fiscal year?\n* Is the purchase not within my budget this fiscal year?\n* Is there an agreement that needs to be signed?\n* Are there legal T&Cs in the agreement that will bind Mattermost if signed?\n\nIf you answer **YES** to one or more of the questions above, you should [submit a PO](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/purchasing/airbase/how-to-submit-a-purchase-order) in Airbase. This way Mattermost is able to track when spending will occur; what legal T&Cs we are binding the company to; manage cash flows; track to fiscal year plan; denote deviations; and ensure correct record keeping for our financial statements and legal contracts. When completing the form, please be sure that:\n\n1. You own the vendor relationship.\n2. You have the approvals from your Manager to move forward on the spend request.\n\nOnce a PO is submitted, the request is routed to the [Procurement Team](mailto:procurement@mattermost.com) to process, review and obtain the spending approval.\n\n### Step 2: Request contract from vendor\n\nIf you did not provide a contract in the PO submission and have received spend approval, ask your vendor contact to send you a **Word Document** of their contract so that Legal may review and if necessary, REDLINE the agreement. You may reference the legal review process outlined in the [Authorization Matrix](https://drive.google.com/a/mattermost.com/open?id=1fDIMiO0uydB_1zCUxZ4sGfSnBJ0P_49zbeQGgTqbYPI).\n\nAll contracts are to address either Ian Tien \\(CEO\\) or Kendra Niedziejko \\(CFO\\), and should include the following relevant information:\n\n| Type | Information |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Contract Signer | Kendra Niedziejko (up to $100,000, or Ian Tien if above $100,000) |\n| Address | 530 Lytton Avenue, Second floor Palo Alto, CA, 94301, USA |\n| Office Phone Number\\* | \\(650\\) 667-8512 |\n| Invoice Sumbission Email | AP@mattermost.com |\n| All Inquiries | Procurement@mattermost.com |\n\n* Please do not use a phone number other than the company number. \n\n#### Is your contract an [MTA](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/risk-management#mattermost-templated-agreement)?\n\nA signed [Mattermost Templated Agreement](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/risk-management#mattermost-templated-agreement) can usually be provisioned within 24 hours from request. Using non-standard or vendor-papered T&Cs will exponentially increase review. On average it takes 2-3 weeks.\n\n#### Is your contract or agreement an addendum?\n\nIf the agreement is an addendum to the original contract that has already been approved and the addendum does not change pricing, then spend approval is not required again. Instead, please attach the addendum to your PO submission, so that it can be reviewed by Legal. There is no need to follow Step 2 onward.\n\n#### Is your request for spend under an existing contract?\n\nIf the original contract has already been approved by Legal and you are submitting a new order form that only impacts pricing, create a new issue by [submitting another PO](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/purchasing/airbase/how-to-submit-a-purchase-order) in Airbase. Additional legal review will not be required.\n\n### Step 3: [Legal review and approval](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/risk-management#legal-review-and-approval-lra)\n\nLegal review is required for most contracts unless the contract adopts Mattermost\u2019s Standard T&Cs or [MTA](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/risk-management#mattermost-templated-agreement).\n\n**\\[PLACEHOLDER - Link to standard T&Cs\\]**\n\nIf the contract cannot be approved, Legal will provide REDLINES, and [Procurement Team](mailto:procurement@mattermost.com) will negotiate directly with the Vendor.\n\nPlease note that the Procurement Team (procurement@mattermost.com) processes the contracts in the order they are received. Our SLA timeline is one to two weeks, so please plan accordingly when submitting a PO.\n\n### Step 4: Send for internal signature\n\nOnce the contract is approved, the Procurement Team will prepare the [contract for signing](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-agreements).\n\n1. Create a PDF of the fully approved contract.\n2. Director or above will initial in DocuSign.\n3. Contract sent to CFO or CEO for final signature in DocuSign.\n\nPlease note that contracts that don\u2019t go through our internal signing process will take much longer to procure and sign.\n\n### Step 5: Send signed contract for counter-signature\n\nOnce a contract is signed by Mattermost, a PDF version will be sent to the vendor for counter-signature by either the [Procurement Team](mailto:procurement@mattermost.com) or Requester (depending on the nature of the vendor relationship) and the Requester will be CC\u2019d on the email for visibility.\n\n### Step 6: Upload completed contract\n\nSend the final counter-signed contract to the [Procurement Team](mailto:procurement@mattermost.com) to file away.\n\n### Step 7: Vendor on-boarding and invoice processing\n\nFor all vendor on-boarding questions, refer to the [How to on-board a vendor](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/spending-company-money/procurement/how-to-on-board-as-a-vendor) and [How to get paid](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-get-paid). Please be sure to communicate to your vendor that all invoices should include the PO number for reference.\n",

Our SLA timeline is one to two weeks, so please plan accordingly when submitting a PO.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Send for internal signature</h3>\n<p>Once the contract is approved, the Procurement Team will prepare the <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-agreements\">contract for signing</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a PDF of the fully approved contract.</li>\n<li>Director or above will initial in DocuSign.</li>\n<li>Contract sent to CFO or CEO for final signature in DocuSign.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please note that contracts that don\u2019t go through our internal signing process will take much longer to procure and sign.</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Send signed contract for counter-signature</h3>\n<p>Once a contract is signed by Mattermost, a PDF version will be sent to the vendor for counter-signature by either the <a href=\"mailto:procurement@mattermost.com\">Procurement Team</a> or Requester (depending on the nature of the vendor relationship) and the Requester will be CC\u2019d on the email for visibility.</p>\n<h3>Step 6: Upload completed contract</h3>\n<p>Send the final counter-signed contract to the <a href=\"mailto:procurement@mattermost.com\">Procurement Team</a> to file away.</p>\n<h3>Step 7: Vendor on-boarding and invoice processing</h3>\n<p>For all vendor on-boarding questions, refer to the <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/spending-company-money/procurement/how-to-on-board-as-a-vendor\">How to on-board a vendor</a> and <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-get-paid\">How to get paid</a>.

        "content": "## Gifts and entertainment policy\n\n### Overview\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to provide staff members with information and guidelines to empower them to make informed decisions about receiving and giving gifts and entertainment from third party vendors and to customers, respectively. Mattermost staff members are required to adhere to the company\u2019s mission and leadership principles and in addition, follow the local laws of their country that may apply. \n\n### What is considered a gift or entertainment?\n\nA gift can be any of the following, monetary or otherwise:\n\n1. Swag or promotional item\n2. Gift basket\n3. Gift certificates/gift cards\n4. Discounts on services\n5. Cash or any form of compensation\n\nEntertainment can be any of the following:\n\n1. Meal\n2. Refreshments, such as beer, wine, or cocktails\n3. Tickets to an event\n4. Transportation provided to an event\n\n### Gift and entertainment guidelines\n\nWhen giving or receiving gifts and entertainment, always refer back to Mattermost\u2019s mission and leadership principles.\n\n[Mattermost Mission](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#mission)\n[Mattermost Leadership Principles](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles)\n\nWhen giving or receiving a gift, ask yourself:\n\n1. Is this gift nominal in value?\n2. How will others and the public perceive this gift?\n3. Could this gift be seen in any way as a bribe?\n4. Will this gift influence the decisions made by the recipient?\n5. Am I truly building up goodwill and trust, as well as strengthening working relationships with this gift?\n6. Am I breaking or violating the local laws by accepting or giving this gift?\n7. Does this gift go beyond the common courtesies consistent with ethical and accepted business practices?\n8. Was this raffle or giveaway done randomly and in a public forum? Is the prize excessive?\n9. If the appropriateness of the gift is in question, has a manager been consulted?\n10. Do I understand the intention of giving or receiving the gift?\n11. Have I alerted my manager of the gift?\n\nWhen giving or receiving a gift, the gift must be of nominal value and there is no risk of creating a perception that the gift, in any way, shape or form, influenced the recipient of their decision making. Gifts of nominal value can be company swag, like mugs, t-shirts, stickers, or other promotional items. In some cases, a gift can be a gift card or certificate for participating in a survey or testing a new product and providing feedback. This is an acceptable form of gift, so long as the amount is no more than $50 USD. Entertainment can be a meal, refreshment, such as an alcoholic beverage or soft drink, or a ticket to a cultural or sporting event. For example, inviting a customer to MatterCon.\n\nAs a reminder, staff members are required to follow the local laws for the country that may apply and when in doubt, please consult their manager prior to giving or receiving the potential gift.\n\n### Unacceptable gifts\n\nIt is never acceptable to give or receive gifts or entertainment that are in exchange for personal gain, unfair business advantage or influence decision making. It is also never acceptable to give or receive gifts or entertainment that is illegal, per local country laws, or that would violate Mattermost\u2019s mission or values. \n\nAn unacceptable gift can be:\n\n1. Excessive cash amounts\n2. Gift items of excessive value\n3. Stocks\n4. Bonds\n5. Stock Options\n6. Loans\n\nIn the event that a staff member receives a gift or entertainment that is deemed unacceptable, inappropriate or illegal, the staff member should report it to their manager and politely return the gift and explain that Mattermost policy does not permit them to accept the gift. In the event that a gift cannot be returned, the staff member should reach out to the Compliance team for assistance.\n\n_Government and Political Activities_\n\nUnder no circumstances should gifts or entertainment be given to or received from government officials, employees or contractors as this may appear to be a means of influence or bribe. Failure to avoid these activities may lead to violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. For additional information on the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, please refer to this [page](https://www.trade.gov/us-foreign-corrupt-practices-act#:~:text=Under%20the%20Foreign%20Corrupt%20Practices,of%20obtaining%20or%20retaining%20business).\n\nStaff members have the right to support the political process as it applies to their home country. Support for these political affiliations should be conducted during their personal time and should not be conducted on company time or involve the use of company resources. Staff members are not permitted to make any political contributions on behalf of Mattermost.\n\n_Charitable Contributions_\n\nAs with political activities, staff members may not use company resources to personally support a charitable organization or other not for profit organizations. Staff members are not permitted to make any charitable contributions on behalf of Mattermost.\n\n### Next steps\n\nIf you have any questions on gift giving or receiving to and from external third parties, please contact our Legal (legal@mattermost.com) team for assistance.\n\nIf you have received a gift, please contact our Legal (legal@mattermost.com) and Finance Team (expenses@mattermost.com).

Mattermost staff members are required to adhere to the company\u2019s mission and leadership principles and in addition, follow the local laws of their country that may apply. </p>\n<h3>What is considered a gift or entertainment?</h3>\n<p>A gift can be any of the following, monetary or otherwise:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Swag or promotional item</li>\n<li>Gift basket</li>\n<li>Gift certificates/gift cards</li>\n<li>Discounts on services</li>\n<li>Cash or any form of compensation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Entertainment can be any of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Meal</li>\n<li>Refreshments, such as beer, wine, or cocktails</li>\n<li>Tickets to an event</li>\n<li>Transportation provided to an event</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Gift and entertainment guidelines</h3>\n<p>When giving or receiving gifts and entertainment, always refer back to Mattermost\u2019s mission and leadership principles.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#mission\">Mattermost Mission</a>\n<a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles\">Mattermost Leadership Principles</a></p>\n<p>When giving or receiving a gift, ask yourself:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is this gift nominal in value?</li>\n<li>How will others and the public perceive this gift?</li>\n<li>Could this gift be seen in any way as a bribe?</li>\n<li>Will this gift influence the decisions made by the recipient?</li>\n<li>Am I truly building up goodwill and trust, as well as strengthening working relationships with this gift?</li>\n<li>Am I breaking or violating the local laws by accepting or giving this gift?</li>\n<li>Does this gift go beyond the common courtesies consistent with ethical and accepted business practices?</li>\n<li>Was this raffle or giveaway done randomly and in a public forum? Is the prize excessive?</li>\n<li>If the appropriateness of the gift is in question, has a manager been consulted?</li>\n<li>Do I understand the intention of giving or receiving the gift?</li>\n<li>Have I alerted my manager of the gift?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When giving or receiving a gift, the gift must be of nominal value and there is no risk of creating a perception that the gift, in any way, shape or form, influenced the recipient of their decision making. Gifts of nominal value can be company swag, like mugs, t-shirts, stickers, or other promotional items. In some cases, a gift can be a gift card or certificate for participating in a survey or testing a new product and providing feedback. This is an acceptable form of gift, so long as the amount is no more than $50 USD. Entertainment can be a meal, refreshment, such as an alcoholic beverage or soft drink, or a ticket to a cultural or sporting event. For example, inviting a customer to MatterCon.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, staff members are required to follow the local laws for the country that may apply and when in doubt, please consult their manager prior to giving or receiving the potential gift.</p>\n<h3>Unacceptable gifts</h3>\n<p>It is never acceptable to give or receive gifts or entertainment that are in exchange for personal gain, unfair business advantage or influence decision making. It is also never acceptable to give or receive gifts or entertainment that is illegal, per local country laws, or that would violate Mattermost\u2019s mission or values. </p>\n<p>An unacceptable gift can be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Excessive cash amounts</li>\n<li>Gift items of excessive value</li>\n<li>Stocks</li>\n<li>Bonds</li>\n<li>Stock Options</li>\n<li>Loans</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the event that a staff member receives a gift or entertainment that is deemed unacceptable, inappropriate or illegal, the staff member should report it to their manager and politely return the gift and explain that Mattermost policy does not permit them to accept the gift. In the event that a gift cannot be returned, the staff member should reach out to the Compliance team for assistance.</p>\n<p><em>Government and Political Activities</em></p>\n<p>Under no circumstances should gifts or entertainment be given to or received from government officials, employees or contractors as this may appear to be a means of influence or bribe. Failure to avoid these activities may lead to violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. For additional information on the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, please refer to this <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/us-foreign-corrupt-practices-act#:~:text=Under%20the%20Foreign%20Corrupt%20Practices,of%20obtaining%20or%20retaining%20business\">page</a>.</p>\n<p>Staff members have the right to support the political process as it applies to their home country. Support for these political affiliations should be conducted during their personal time and should not be conducted on company time or involve the use of company resources. Staff members are not permitted to make any political contributions on behalf of Mattermost.</p>\n<p><em>Charitable Contributions</em></p>\n<p>As with political activities, staff members may not use company resources to personally support a charitable organization or other not for profit organizations. Staff members are not permitted to make any charitable contributions on behalf of Mattermost.</p>\n<h3>Next steps</h3>\n<p>If you have any questions on gift giving or receiving to and from external third parties, please contact our Legal (legal@mattermost.com) team for assistance.</p>\n<p>If you have received a gift, please contact our Legal (legal@mattermost.com) and Finance Team (expenses@mattermost.com). The Finance team can help assess tax implications on your gift, if any. The tax rules for gifts will depend on your country/region of residence and the value of the gift offered to you. </p>",

Select the orange **Request PO** button.\n\n![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/How-to-submit-a-PO-1.PNG)\n\nFill in the primary information in the **Request a New Purchase Order** form. The screenshot below highlights all the required fields for successful submission.\n\n![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/How-to-submit-a-PO-2.PNG)\n\nMapping key to each field and purpose:\n\n1. **Vendor/Supplier:** This is a search bar. The vendor name must match exactly for the vendor to appear available. Refer to Finding a Vendor for steps detailing how to successfully locate a vendor.\n   * **Add Vendor:** Only click this button if you have taken all previous steps to determine if your vendor exists as an active vendor in our repository. Refer to section Requesting a Vendor.\n2. **Payment terms:** Mattermost standard payment terms is Net 30, meaning that payment is due within 30 days of the date the invoice is received. If your vendor has shorter payment terms \\(such as payment due within 15 days or Net 15\\), please reach out to Procurement@mattermost.com or [Finance Team Channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/expenses) for approval.\n3. **Amount:** This field is intentionally grayed out as it auto-fills based on the information in the PO Expenses section.\n4. **Start Date/End Date:** These are the dates for when the services will start and complete. For goods being delivered on a specific date, the start and end date should match.\n5. **Date/Receive By Date:** This is automatically populated based on today\u2019s date. This may be changed, but is not recommended as this will account at the request date. The **Receive by** field is the date you would ideally like to PO to be approved. Note that we still maintain standard SLAs. If the request is urgent, we will do our best to accommodate but make no guarantees. If you're working with a new vendor on negotiations, it's advisable to bring the Procurement team as early as possible to avoid any potential delays or missed dates.\n6. **Location:** This is the country that the vendor is physically providing services from.\n7. **Currency Code:** Represents the currency preferred by the vendor and what the vendor will invoice Mattermost. This should be defined in the contract.\n8. **Department:** This field is a drop down list. If you're completing a PO Request Form for yourself, it's generally assumed the spend will map to your department. If you're unsure what department you belong to, you can reference your department in BambooHR as seen in the screenshot below. If you're submitting a PO on behalf of someone else, it's advised to use their department in BambooHR. If you believe spend should be allocated to more than one department, make note of this in the **Description/Notes** section of the form.\n\n![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/How-to-submit-a-PO-3.PNG)\n\n1. **Description/Notes:** It\u2019s important that we collect as much information as possible of the purpose and intent of the goods/services that the vendor is providing to Mattermost. The more information the better. However, at a minimum we require the following:\n   * _Type of Service:_ Software, consulting spend, contractor, etc.\n   * _Purpose:_ The intention for requesting spend: Example: Product software for UX design or contractor spend for Salesforce administration.\n   * _Type of Spend:_ Is this a fixed amount or variable. Be explicit as to what you are purchasing. Example: monthly retainer for the same amount over 4 months would be considered fixed versus billing on a number of registered users would be variable.\n   * _Invoice Billing Frequency:_ Monthly, quarterly, annually, etc.\n\n## Adding Attachments\n\nIn general, a supporting document or form should accompany the purchase order request. To upload a document, find the blue **Add Attachments** button at the bottom of the **Request a New Purchase Order** form. Attach all associated legal documents needed for review. Some examples of legal documents may include:\n\n1. Vendor Master Service Agreement\n2. Vendor Online Terms and Conditions\n3. Vendor Supplier Form\n4. Vendor Purchase Order Form\n5. Vendor Service Order Form\n6. Sponsorship Agreement\n7. Corporate Agreement\n8. Addendum or Amendment to a Contract\n\n![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/How-to-submit-a-PO-4.PNG)\n\n## Finding a Vendor\n\nIf you're unsure whether your vendor is on file or unsure of the legal name of the vendor, you can refer to the Vendor Module to quickly look up a vendor by entering the name of the vendor in the column titled **Vendor** as seen in the screenshot below.\n\n![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/How-to-submit-a-PO-5.PNG)\n\nVendors are named in our system based on the legal name provided on the vendor's W-9. However, the vendor may be Doing Business As \u201cDBA\u201d under an alternative alias.\n\n**Example**: Netsuite is owned by Oracle, Inc. We are billed by Oracle but the software known at Mattermost is Netsuite.\n\nIf you're unable to locate the vendor and believe that your vendor is active, reach out to the Accounting team at AP@mattermost.com or the [Purchases Channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/purchases).\n\n## Requesting a Vendor\n\nIf you're unable to find the vendor in question through the recommended channels, then select the blue **Add Vendor** button and complete the basic vendor information:\n\n* Vendor Module\n* **Vendor/Supplier** search field on the **Request a New Purchase Order** form\n* Accounting Team is unable to locate the vendor or DBA name\n\nIf your vendor is a US vendor or supplier and you have a copy of their W-9, upload the signed documents by clicking the blue **Upload W9** button. Don't check **Send Welcome Email** if this appears on your screen. The Finance team will send the new vendor a welcome email once the PO has gone through the proper approval process.\n\n![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/How-to-submit-a-PO-6.PNG)\n\nWhen completing the New Vendor Details, be mindful of the following:\n\n* If the PO request is in a currency other than USD, you can use the currency in the **Currency Code** drop down menu. After you submit the PO, the amount will convert to USD.\n\n## How to complete PO Expenses section\n\nAt the bottom half of the page under **Request a New Purchase Order** is a section titled **PO Expenses**. This should be completed as well, but don\u2019t worry if you get this wrong. The Finance team will be reviewing these sections thoroughly and modifying the PO forms on the back-end. That said, it's still beneficial to complete the following sections:\n\n1. **Category:** Represents the type of spend that you will incur. A full list of expenses, definitions, and examples can be found in the Expense Category Definitions table.\n2. **Amount:** Represents the total requested dollar amount. The request should be based on the currency which the vendor will invoice Mattermost. The **Currency Code** selected above will drive the amount.\n3. **Department:** Should mirror the department selected in the section above.\n4. **Location:** Should mirror the location selected in the section above.\n5. **Business Unit:** Classifications used to categorize spend. A full list of expenses, definitions, and examples can be found in the Business Unit Definitions table.\n6. **Start and end dates:** Should mirror the start and end dates in the section above.\n7. **Memo:** Copy and paste the text from the **Description** section above.\n\n**Note:** You don't need to choose an **Account and Amortization Template**.\n\n![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/How-to-submit-a-PO-7.PNG)\n\nThe Procurement team will reach out to you if additional information is needed.\n\nOnce the form is complete, attach the appropriate legal documents and click **Submit** to start the approval workflow process. You can always check the status of your request in the Purchase Order Module or feel free to reach out to procurement@mattermost.com for further details on your request.\n\n## Business Unit Definitions\n\nPlease note that these Business Units are similar to the Classifications found in Expensify.\n\n| Business Unit | Definition |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Advisor | Expense related to Advisory services for MM |\n| Bounty Projects | Fees for Services Related to Bounty Projects |\n| Business Operations | Expenses to support office and business operations; stamps, postage, supplies, snacks, etc. |\n| Conferences & Trade Shows | Expenses incurred to get to, attend, or stay at Conference/Trade Show |\n| Consultants | Expense related for payment to Non-ROW Consultants & Contractors |\n| Customer Facing | Expenses incurred when meeting, spending time, or entertaining a current or potential customer |\n| Marketing Events | Expenses incurred to attend marketing events, seminars, etc. |\n| Mattercon | Expenses for Mattercon events only |\n| Community Member | Community Member expenses for Mattercon events only |\n| Onboarding | Expenses for new hire home and office equipment; travel for onboarding training, etc. |\n| Recurring Subscriptions | Expenses that are recurring in nature and support business operations; mobile subscriptions, software licenses, etc. |\n| Simulation Projects | Expenses for candidate simulation projects sponsored by Mattermost |\n| Staff | Expense related for payment of Monthly Salary & Periodic Bonuses to ROW Staff |\n| Support | Revenue and CoS for customer support products |\n| Systems | Expenses, greater than $500, incurred for work performed on systems |\n| Team Celebration | Expenses for department head approved celebration with staff members |\n| Team Events, Meetups & Offsites | Expenses incurred for Team Events, Meetups, or Offsites, which include all known travel costs |\n| Training | Expenses incurred for work-related online courses and professional development certifications |\n\n## Expense Category Definitions\n\n| Expense Category | Definition | Examples | GL Acct \\# |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Advertising | Online and print advertising | Google ads, Facebook ads, Twitter ads | 66060 |\n| Advisory or Consulting | Advisory \\(individuals or firms\\) or consulting \\(firms\\) services provided to Mattermost | TrustArc, BPE Global | 12040 |\n| Audit and Tax Fees | Audit and tax services provided to Mattermost | PwC, EY, Deloitte | 62040 |\n| Candidate Attainment Projects | Simulations and other related projects for prospective candidates | Simulation projects | 62030 |\n| Company Events | Services provided to Mattermost for company sponsored events | Mattercon | 60530 |\n| Company Swag | Mattermost branded swag NOT for marketing campaigns | Printfection, Kotis | 60540 |\n| Conference and Seminars | Conferences and seminars \\(NOT Marketing related\\) |  | 63070 |\n| Contractor or Consultant | Individuals who will provide contractor or consulting services to Mattermost at an hourly or fixed fee for a specified period of time | Bounty Projects, contractors with SOWs | 62030 |\n| Dues & Subscriptions | Dues and Subscription fees for professional, technical or trade publications | Financial Times, Wall Street Journal | 64010 |\n| Hosting COS | Hosting web services \\(e.g. AWS\\) - allocation for Cost of Sales | AWS | 50020 |\n| Hosting Expense | Hosting web services \\(e.g. AWS\\) | AWS | 64080 |\n| HR Fees | Human resource services \\(individuals and firms\\) provided to Mattermost | TriNet, Vistra | 62070 |\n| Job Advertising | Fees paid to advertise open positions to potential candidates \\(e.g. job boards\\) | StackOver Flow, Cyber Coders, Indeed, LinkedIn | 61050 |\n| Legal Fees | Legal and compliance services \\(individuals and firms\\) provided to Mattermost | Law firms | 62050 |\n| Marketing Promotional Materials | Promotional marketing materials |  | 66040 |\n| Marketing Swag | Mattermost branded swag for marketing campaigns only | Zazzle, Printfection | 66070 |\n| Prepaid Insurance | All types of insurance policies, varying in period of time and premium amounts | The Hartford | 12010 |\n| Prepaid Marketing & Advertising | Marketing and advertising services \\(e.g. public relations, search engine optimization and web & content development etc.\\) provided to Mattermost |  | 12020 |\n| Prepaid Software/SaaS Licenses | Software license fees paid in advance \\(a year or more\\) | NetSuite, Celigo, Snowflake, SalesForce | 12030 |\n| Recruiting Fees | Fees paid to third party recruiters for candidate placement |  | 61010 |\n| Recruiting Services | Fees paid to third party service firms for recruitment efforts |  | 61020 |\n| Software Expense | Software licenses and subscription \\(monthly\\) | Figma, Dribbble | 64040 |\n\n",

Select the orange <strong>Request PO</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../../.gitbook/assets/How-to-submit-a-PO-1.PNG\" /></p>\n<p>Fill in the primary information in the <strong>Request a New Purchase Order</strong> form. The screenshot below highlights all the required fields for successful submission.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../../.gitbook/assets/How-to-submit-a-PO-2.PNG\" /></p>\n<p>Mapping key to each field and purpose:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Vendor/Supplier:</strong> This is a search bar. The vendor name must match exactly for the vendor to appear available. Refer to Finding a Vendor for steps detailing how to successfully locate a vendor.</li>\n<li><strong>Add Vendor:</strong> Only click this button if you have taken all previous steps to determine if your vendor exists as an active vendor in our repository. Refer to section Requesting a Vendor.</li>\n<li><strong>Payment terms:</strong> Mattermost standard payment terms is Net 30, meaning that payment is due within 30 days of the date the invoice is received. If your vendor has shorter payment terms (such as payment due within 15 days or Net 15), please reach out to Procurement@mattermost.com or <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/expenses\">Finance Team Channel</a> for approval.</li>\n<li><strong>Amount:</strong> This field is intentionally grayed out as it auto-fills based on the information in the PO Expenses section.</li>\n<li><strong>Start Date/End Date:</strong> These are the dates for when the services will start and complete. For goods being delivered on a specific date, the start and end date should match.</li>\n<li><strong>Date/Receive By Date:</strong> This is automatically populated based on today\u2019s date. This may be changed, but is not recommended as this will account at the request date. The <strong>Receive by</strong> field is the date you would ideally like to PO to be approved. Note that we still maintain standard SLAs. If the request is urgent, we will do our best to accommodate but make no guarantees. If you're working with a new vendor on negotiations, it's advisable to bring the Procurement team as early as possible to avoid any potential delays or missed dates.</li>\n<li><strong>Location:</strong> This is the country that the vendor is physically providing services from.</li>\n<li><strong>Currency Code:</strong> Represents the currency preferred by the vendor and what the vendor will invoice Mattermost. This should be defined in the contract.</li>\n<li><strong>Department:</strong> This field is a drop down list. If you're completing a PO Request Form for yourself, it's generally assumed the spend will map to your department. If you're unsure what department you belong to, you can reference your department in BambooHR as seen in the screenshot below. If you're submitting a PO on behalf of someone else, it's advised to use their department in BambooHR. If you believe spend should be allocated to more than one department, make note of this in the <strong>Description/Notes</strong> section of the form.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../../.gitbook/assets/How-to-submit-a-PO-3.PNG\" /></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Description/Notes:</strong> It\u2019s important that we collect as much information as possible of the purpose and intent of the goods/services that the vendor is providing to Mattermost. The more information the better. However, at a minimum we require the following:</li>\n<li><em>Type of Service:</em> Software, consulting spend, contractor, etc.</li>\n<li><em>Purpose:</em> The intention for requesting spend: Example: Product software for UX design or contractor spend for Salesforce administration.</li>\n<li><em>Type of Spend:</em> Is this a fixed amount or variable. Be explicit as to what you are purchasing. Example: monthly retainer for the same amount over 4 months would be considered fixed versus billing on a number of registered users would be variable.</li>\n<li><em>Invoice Billing Frequency:</em> Monthly, quarterly, annually, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Adding Attachments</h2>\n<p>In general, a supporting document or form should accompany the purchase order request. To upload a document, find the blue <strong>Add Attachments</strong> button at the bottom of the <strong>Request a New Purchase Order</strong> form.

This guide, along with all our guides, is a work-in-progress and\n  iterates as we consider new data and frameworks.\n---\n\n# How to use Expensify\n\nExpensify is our global expense tracking software for all reimbursable and non-reimbursable expenses. All expenses, regardless of cost, must include an itemized receipt for tracking and approving purposes. As part of your onboarding experience, you will be provisioned on one or more Expensify policies depending on your level and if you have direct reports. If you do not have an Expensify account, please reach out to the [Finance Team](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/purchases) who will provision you with an Expensify account.\n\n## Preparing and submitting expense reports\n\nWhen preparing an expense report, you should consolidate the report based on the activity\\(ies\\).\n\n**Monthly Recurring Expense activities** should be consolidated on one [Expense Report](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#creating-a-report) monthly. These include mobile reimbursement, flexible office space, and so on.\n\n**Non-Recurring Expense activities** should be broken up by event and separated by an [Expense Report](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#creating-a-report). Common events include the following:\n\n* **Travel**: You should have 2 expense reports:\n  * **Flight expense report**: This will include airfare paid for in advance of your trip.\n  * **Travel expense report**: This will include hotel, meals, Uber/taxis, etc. incurred during the time of your travel.\n* **Equipment**: When onboarding, all expenses should be submitted on the same expense report in the month incurred.\n\nExpenses for the same trip or report that is submitted on multiple [Expense Report](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#creating-a-report) \\(e.g. in piecemeal\\) will be pushed back to the submitter to amend.\n\nAll expenses should be submitted in a timely manner and therefore we request that expenses incurred in the month are submitted in an expense report within the same month. Long outstanding receipts submitted outside the month incurred are subject to additional review and in certain cases could be rejected.\n\n### Creating a report\n\nYou can create a report in Expensify in two ways:\n\n1. Create the report before you incur expense and add the expenses as they arise or, \n2. Consolidate all your expenses from your trip/event/onboarding and apply them to the report. \n\nTo create a report, follow the directions below:\n\n1. On the left-hand corner of your home screen, are four tabs listed vertically: **Inbox**, **Expenses**, **Reports**, and **Settings**. Select **Reports**.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/W6IMHtjgCfl6NG3EZ6hU42Sw5dEhDMrUSZI2_kZSh5ToR9hFjBqpHm9gBp1s_Da9h4JugmceDBnceYaoaNjClRJHkoh3hyN1NMt162ua7NJ5OXQdq3sMTBCGHLTmciERJszakVTa)\n\n1. On the **Reports** page, select **New Report** located in the top-right corner of your screen.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kQkvDLFjvR_Z_9sM7yIUp_RNYftuiZJsQAGyzj71VEq30GYRMiv-w6s3p9FlkHoGEu1DkffgHFWA5ptk78lImnUp1lOh3ecNyu4vRsyJl5waiVblsHJ96koF5YOjhhe4n37CDi2r)\n\n1. Select **New Report** to automatically populate a report where you can begin to add expenses. Note that the **Report Name** is auto-generated with the following information from your profile:\n   1. **Name:** First and Last\n   2. **Start Date:** First date an expense was incurred on your report\n   3. **End Date:** Last date an expense was incurred on your report\n   4. **Report Number:** Auto-generated by Expensify\n   5. **Currency:** The primary currency for reimbursement\n\nIt is also important that you are submitting under the correct policy \\(as seen below\\). Please double check this information before proceeding.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GxTZZHtyymVE8hikQfyDrBOEpuwHJ_sr6L6mK3vosudI6XqM0TrEDOIlNeelzq3b74duoTyi3M8icdU_V26J5wog79JuAf2EQW3if9Lm_8hn8ecVsPm0K3jYKR0loWU2SIUbLE6s)\n\n1. Next, you can begin to [add receipts](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#adding-receipts).\n\n### Adding receipts\n\nReceipts are relatively easy to add. You can add expenses in one of two ways: directly to the report you created or standalone where you can add to a report at a later date. It's best practice that once you have received a bill or receipt for your expense, either log into your Expensify account or use the Expensify mobile app to take a screenshot of your receipt\\(s\\) and upload them to your expense queue \\(as seen below\\). You can use Expensify\u2019s **SmartScanning** technology to pre-populate some of the information. Alternative, you can manually fill in the details yourself.\n\nOnce you have more time to sit down and sift through your expenses, you can then code these to the correct reports.\n\n1. Add expenses to the **Expenses** queue by selecting **Expenses** left-hand navigation.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zW1BAEbgUzbF_DB343Kw6kh3ToJAh--vUslTURFbOBIvn3Q6TICf18ELOlxv6_FxO8B4u7TPrHuvyFiJTq6kvN_4Ugs_emWCyp7-4kNgrGN2RP71ZKWmQvBlE0cSJacwvkV0Wf5K)\n\n1. Once on the **Expenses** page, you can view existing expenses not yet filed to an expense report or create a **New Expense**.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/REL1YWv_BFVjDwCmLzcX0WYDQFA0mzsOrPEKkkMw1mxBe7Htme2Rq1OqcCEq1Riwf5b3hDZmBcmavedUw79UE9WaqorWtMSJK9AIZTgdB7c0gKra8va2AeogiJ56Tl2wu9BmsrX7)\n\n1. Under **New Expenses**, you can choose to upload your receipt in one of three ways: **Scan Receipt**, **Manually Create**, or **Create Multiple**. It's recommended to scan or manually create a receipt to avoid any complications and expense processing issues.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sgXwg0rTGH2Fnh2NgVrmYZyb5uScWnbeGEkpmo2IlYuf4XOYfn1C9Hz1jdhuwngPGcf8PgEKiIWGnBfTH84_tr_lvS4EE9lp7qI8c5hdxaRmbtSAXRN6LW-MKApy509LQQn6zGfE)\n\n1. For manually created expenses, you will be taken to a screen \\(as seen below\\) to begin coding your expenses. For Scanned Receipts, you will first need to select a file from your drive to upload for SmartScanning.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yE3l-Bual-Ub5LGbkD50f-azi0pzQHZhELvG_8VGEfRQpJtn3HsU3xYEGDHOGr-4PQlymgr3n2Y-4kWee9h0x6lqv1CttalHBa0HZxQyB16EalOatvcLT05HyibpR8yLN1kclGVj)\n\n1. For new expenses, all fields are mandatory to complete. Below is the list and purpose of each category for submitting at Mattermost:\n   1. **Merchant:** This is the vendor with whom you incurred the expense.\n   2. **Date:** The date noted on the receipt.\n   3. **Total:** Amount billed and the currency in which the expense was incurred.\n   4. **Category:** Category is an important and mandatory field as the coding directly impacts the face of the financial statements and P&L. This is a very important field that should be reviewed and considered thoughtfully. We have provided detailed descriptions and examples for each [Category](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#categories) below. Should you have questions please reach out the the [Purchases](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/purchases) channel.\n   5. **Attendees:** This should include all individuals \\(staff member or external person\\) involved in the expense. For example, a dinner with a customer should include the names of all the customers and internal staff members who attended.\n   6. **Classification:** This is a mandatory field that impacts budgetary reporting. To facilitate the correct categorization, we have provided detailed descriptions and examples for each [Classification](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#classification) below. Should you have questions or if you find there is no classification relevant to the expense, please reach out to the [Purchases](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/purchases) channel.\n   7. **Description:** All expenses should have a description for the business need. The more detail the better. Please see below for examples that can be used to guide you in completing this filed. \n      1. **Example 1**: John Smith just bought his new onboarding equipment which includes a Lenovo Carbon X laptop and an AmazonBasics HDMI Cable in Houston, Texas. Below are examples of expense descriptions:\n         1. Carbon X Lenovo Laptop for onboarding\n         2. HDMI cable for onboarding\n      2. **Example 2**: Alison Henry has just completed her trip to Sweden where she met the VP of IT for Spotify. She incurred the following business expenses while on her trip: United flight roundtrip, dinner at Morrison Steakhouse, and a personal breakfast at the Hilton Hotel. Below are examples of expense descriptions:\n         1. Flight to visit Spotify at headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden\n         2. Spotify customer dinner at Morrison Steakhouse in Stockholm, Sweden\n         3. Hotel stay at Hilton in Stockholm, Sweden for Spotify\n\nOnce your expense has been completed, you can add this to an existing expense report or let it stay in the **Expenses** queue until you're ready to add it to a trip/event/onboarding report.\n\n## When approving an expense report\n\nIf you are a manager and reviewing a staff member's expense report, note the following instructions:\n\n1. When an [Expense Report](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-use-expensify#creating-a-report) has been submitted by a staff member, Expensify sends a notification via email to the manager for review.\n2. Click on the report name in the body of the email to navigate to Expensify where you can review the report.\n3. Review each expense for accuracy and completeness as aligned in the Mattermost\u2019s expense policy, and ensure a receipt is attached. **Note:** we require a receipt for all expenses.\n4. Once reviewed and approved, select **Approve and Forward** from the drop-down and Expensify will designate a pre-populated email address.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/K95GGduA7yvphRDt0PrdEAAUHHVwy7A_NwDGYbVFXTGpxMraLxzizOCPJaZSnQvmxpu_wBH20QZdAEp58uwnOC51MO3Mtx-gF8OuEz6BbsDR1bT7rEi0BQYzjNwGa-4_ZdQtwz0u)\n\n**IMPORTANT** - Please do not use **Final Approval** because Expensify will not send the email notification for payment approval and it will delay the reimbursement process.\n\n1. If you will be Out Of Office, the manager can delegate the approval process during PTO:\n\n   _Settings \u2192 Your Account \u2192 Account Details \u2192 Vacation Delegate \u2192 Enter the email address of the backup approval_\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DjLOEFPKcjOWAuh6QAS98ysglxPSedRmskUPEdqF9dbu_nOzPHAQXK7DjU_P5G8q-9oKE8wrv3A8Sqt0kX6O4YZ8scEyPAxLqjHE7XVGAosvSW8vSpPz8APQRSi80iPAKkBi5IGU)\n\n1.

This guide, along with all our guides, is a work-in-progress and\n  iterates as we consider new data and frameworks.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>How to use Expensify</h1>\n<p>Expensify is our global expense tracking software for all reimbursable and non-reimbursable expenses. All expenses, regardless of cost, must include an itemized receipt for tracking and approving purposes. As part of your onboarding experience, you will be provisioned on one or more Expensify policies depending on your level and if you have direct reports. If you do not have an Expensify account, please reach out to the <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/purchases\">Finance Team</a> who will provision you with an Expensify account.</p>\n<h2>Preparing and submitting expense reports</h2>\n<p>When preparing an expense report, you should consolidate the report based on the activity(ies).</p>\n<p><strong>Monthly Recurring Expense activities</strong> should be consolidated on one <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#creating-a-report\">Expense Report</a> monthly. These include mobile reimbursement, flexible office space, and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-Recurring Expense activities</strong> should be broken up by event and separated by an <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#creating-a-report\">Expense Report</a>. Common events include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Travel</strong>: You should have 2 expense reports:</li>\n<li><strong>Flight expense report</strong>: This will include airfare paid for in advance of your trip.</li>\n<li><strong>Travel expense report</strong>: This will include hotel, meals, Uber/taxis, etc. incurred during the time of your travel.</li>\n<li><strong>Equipment</strong>: When onboarding, all expenses should be submitted on the same expense report in the month incurred.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Expenses for the same trip or report that is submitted on multiple <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#creating-a-report\">Expense Report</a> (e.g. in piecemeal) will be pushed back to the submitter to amend.</p>\n<p>All expenses should be submitted in a timely manner and therefore we request that expenses incurred in the month are submitted in an expense report within the same month. Long outstanding receipts submitted outside the month incurred are subject to additional review and in certain cases could be rejected.</p>\n<h3>Creating a report</h3>\n<p>You can create a report in Expensify in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create the report before you incur expense and add the expenses as they arise or, </li>\n<li>Consolidate all your expenses from your trip/event/onboarding and apply them to the report. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>To create a report, follow the directions below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On the left-hand corner of your home screen, are four tabs listed vertically: <strong>Inbox</strong>, <strong>Expenses</strong>, <strong>Reports</strong>, and <strong>Settings</strong>. Select <strong>Reports</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/W6IMHtjgCfl6NG3EZ6hU42Sw5dEhDMrUSZI2_kZSh5ToR9hFjBqpHm9gBp1s_Da9h4JugmceDBnceYaoaNjClRJHkoh3hyN1NMt162ua7NJ5OXQdq3sMTBCGHLTmciERJszakVTa\" /></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On the <strong>Reports</strong> page, select <strong>New Report</strong> located in the top-right corner of your screen.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kQkvDLFjvR_Z_9sM7yIUp_RNYftuiZJsQAGyzj71VEq30GYRMiv-w6s3p9FlkHoGEu1DkffgHFWA5ptk78lImnUp1lOh3ecNyu4vRsyJl5waiVblsHJ96koF5YOjhhe4n37CDi2r\" /></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select <strong>New Report</strong> to automatically populate a report where you can begin to add expenses. Note that the <strong>Report Name</strong> is auto-generated with the following information from your profile:</li>\n<li><strong>Name:</strong> First and Last</li>\n<li><strong>Start Date:</strong> First date an expense was incurred on your report</li>\n<li><strong>End Date:</strong> Last date an expense was incurred on your report</li>\n<li><strong>Report Number:</strong> Auto-generated by Expensify</li>\n<li><strong>Currency:</strong> The primary currency for reimbursement</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is also important that you are submitting under the correct policy (as seen below).

You can add expenses in one of two ways: directly to the report you created or standalone where you can add to a report at a later date. It's best practice that once you have received a bill or receipt for your expense, either log into your Expensify account or use the Expensify mobile app to take a screenshot of your receipt(s) and upload them to your expense queue (as seen below). You can use Expensify\u2019s <strong>SmartScanning</strong> technology to pre-populate some of the information. Alternative, you can manually fill in the details yourself.</p>\n<p>Once you have more time to sit down and sift through your expenses, you can then code these to the correct reports.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add expenses to the <strong>Expenses</strong> queue by selecting <strong>Expenses</strong> left-hand navigation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zW1BAEbgUzbF_DB343Kw6kh3ToJAh--vUslTURFbOBIvn3Q6TICf18ELOlxv6_FxO8B4u7TPrHuvyFiJTq6kvN_4Ugs_emWCyp7-4kNgrGN2RP71ZKWmQvBlE0cSJacwvkV0Wf5K\" /></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Once on the <strong>Expenses</strong> page, you can view existing expenses not yet filed to an expense report or create a <strong>New Expense</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/REL1YWv_BFVjDwCmLzcX0WYDQFA0mzsOrPEKkkMw1mxBe7Htme2Rq1OqcCEq1Riwf5b3hDZmBcmavedUw79UE9WaqorWtMSJK9AIZTgdB7c0gKra8va2AeogiJ56Tl2wu9BmsrX7\" /></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Under <strong>New Expenses</strong>, you can choose to upload your receipt in one of three ways: <strong>Scan Receipt</strong>, <strong>Manually Create</strong>, or <strong>Create Multiple</strong>.

Below is the list and purpose of each category for submitting at Mattermost:</li>\n<li><strong>Merchant:</strong> This is the vendor with whom you incurred the expense.</li>\n<li><strong>Date:</strong> The date noted on the receipt.</li>\n<li><strong>Total:</strong> Amount billed and the currency in which the expense was incurred.</li>\n<li><strong>Category:</strong> Category is an important and mandatory field as the coding directly impacts the face of the financial statements and P&amp;L. This is a very important field that should be reviewed and considered thoughtfully. We have provided detailed descriptions and examples for each <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#categories\">Category</a> below. Should you have questions please reach out the the <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/purchases\">Purchases</a> channel.</li>\n<li><strong>Attendees:</strong> This should include all individuals (staff member or external person) involved in the expense. For example, a dinner with a customer should include the names of all the customers and internal staff members who attended.</li>\n<li><strong>Classification:</strong> This is a mandatory field that impacts budgetary reporting. To facilitate the correct categorization, we have provided detailed descriptions and examples for each <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#classification\">Classification</a> below. Should you have questions or if you find there is no classification relevant to the expense, please reach out to the <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/purchases\">Purchases</a> channel.</li>\n<li><strong>Description:</strong> All expenses should have a description for the business need. The more detail the better. Please see below for examples that can be used to guide you in completing this filed. <ol>\n<li><strong>Example 1</strong>: John Smith just bought his new onboarding equipment which includes a Lenovo Carbon X laptop and an AmazonBasics HDMI Cable in Houston, Texas. Below are examples of expense descriptions:<ol>\n<li>Carbon X Lenovo Laptop for onboarding</li>\n<li>HDMI cable for onboarding</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Example 2</strong>: Alison Henry has just completed her trip to Sweden where she met the VP of IT for Spotify. She incurred the following business expenses while on her trip: United flight roundtrip, dinner at Morrison Steakhouse, and a personal breakfast at the Hilton Hotel. Below are examples of expense descriptions:<ol>\n<li>Flight to visit Spotify at headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden</li>\n<li>Spotify customer dinner at Morrison Steakhouse in Stockholm, Sweden</li>\n<li>Hotel stay at Hilton in Stockholm, Sweden for Spotify</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once your expense has been completed, you can add this to an existing expense report or let it stay in the <strong>Expenses</strong> queue until you're ready to add it to a trip/event/onboarding report.</p>\n<h2>When approving an expense report</h2>\n<p>If you are a manager and reviewing a staff member's expense report, note the following instructions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When an <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-use-expensify#creating-a-report\">Expense Report</a> has been submitted by a staff member, Expensify sends a notification via email to the manager for review.</li>\n<li>Click on the report name in the body of the email to navigate to Expensify where you can review the report.</li>\n<li>Review each expense for accuracy and completeness as aligned in the Mattermost\u2019s expense policy, and ensure a receipt is attached. <strong>Note:</strong> we require a receipt for all expenses.</li>\n<li>Once reviewed and approved, select <strong>Approve and Forward</strong> from the drop-down and Expensify will designate a pre-populated email address.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/K95GGduA7yvphRDt0PrdEAAUHHVwy7A_NwDGYbVFXTGpxMraLxzizOCPJaZSnQvmxpu_wBH20QZdAEp58uwnOC51MO3Mtx-gF8OuEz6BbsDR1bT7rEi0BQYzjNwGa-4_ZdQtwz0u\" /></p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> - Please do not use <strong>Final Approval</strong> because Expensify will not send the email notification for payment approval and it will delay the reimbursement process.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you will be Out Of Office, the manager can delegate the approval process during PTO:</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Settings \u2192 Your Account \u2192 Account Details \u2192 Vacation Delegate \u2192 Enter the email address of the backup approval</em></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DjLOEFPKcjOWAuh6QAS98ysglxPSedRmskUPEdqF9dbu_nOzPHAQXK7DjU_P5G8q-9oKE8wrv3A8Sqt0kX6O4YZ8scEyPAxLqjHE7XVGAosvSW8vSpPz8APQRSi80iPAKkBi5IGU\" /></p>\n<ol>\n<li>All expense question(s) can be addressed to the <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/purchases\">Purchases</a> channel.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Reporting fields</h2>\n<h3>Categories</h3>\n<p>Categories are expense types such as airfare, hotels, meals, and more.

As staff members, you're empowered to determine and purchase what you need in order to do your job. We value high impact over stringent expense rules and these expense guidelines are intended to help make decisions not hinder movement. Depending on country/region, some items may be way below or way above the averages listed. If you need to spend more to get the right equipment for you to be productive, we trust you\u2019re making purchase decisions to optimize cost and efficiency.\n\nIf you're uncertain, feel free to ask in the [Finance Team](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/expenses) channel, or reach out to expenses@mattermost.com.\n\n## Mattermost guidelines\n\nMattermost\u2019s policy for spending company money is influenced by GitLab, who [open sources its policy on spending company money online](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/spending-company-money/) and who has been [highly successful in an open, frugal, iterative culture](https://about.gitlab.com/2019/09/17/gitlab-series-e-funding/).\n\n1. Spend company money like it's your own money.\n2. You [don't have to ask permission](https://m.signalvnoise.com/you-dont-have-my-permission/) before making purchases on behalf of the company. When in doubt, inform your manager before the purchase or as soon as possible after the purchase.\n3. It's uncommon for you to need all of the items listed below. Use your best judgement and buy them as you need them. If you wonder whether something is considered common, feel free to ask [People Ops](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/ask-people-team) \\(and in turn, People Ops should update the list\\).\n4. You may privately use Mattermost property, a laptop for example, to check your private emails or watch a movie as long as it does not violate the law, harm Mattermost, or interfere with Intellectual Property.\n5. It's generally easiest and fastest for you to make any purchases for office supplies yourself and expense them.

If you're a new staff member joining the team, welcome aboard! Use your best judgement and buy the below items as you need them. **It is uncommon for you to need all of the items listed below**. If you wonder whether something is common, feel free to ask your manager if it's specific to a role that's only under your manager or in the [People Ops](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/ask-people-team) channel if it's general \\(and in turn, People Ops should update the list\\).\n\nWhile we're sharing average costs for various items below, you should use your best judgement. If there\u2019s a piece of equipment that you\u2019re passionate about, you can spend less on other items to get the product that you want. If you're uncertain, check with your manager or the [Finance Team](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/expenses). In addition, use our [Currency Exchange Tables](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/currency-exchange-table), which are updated monthly, when dealing with reimbursement in currencies other than USD.\n\n### Computer hardware and software\n\nPlease refer to the guidelines [here](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/it/hardware-and-software-purchases)\n\n### Home office guidelines\n\n#### Home office equipment\n\n* Height-adjustable desk: Average price **500 USD**\n  * Example: [https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis.html](https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis.html)\n* Desk chair: Average price **300 USD**\n  * Example: [https://www.fully.com/chairs/fully-desk-chair.html](https://www.fully.com/chairs/fully-desk-chair.html)\n* Laptop stand: Average price **180 USD**\n* Laptop carrying bag: Average price **60 USD**\n* Work-related books: **30 USD** per month or **360 USD** annually\n  * [Recommended resources](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/product-management-team-handbook/professional-development#additional-training-resources)\n#### Business computer accessories\n\n* USB-C dock for New MacBooks: Average price **150 USD**\n* External monitor: Average price **500 USD**\n* HDMI cable: Average price **15 USD**\n* Webcam: Average price **75 USD**\n* Ethernet connector: Average price **20 USD**\n* Headphones: Average price **80 USD**\n* Keyboard and mouse set: Average price **150 USD**\n* IDE for developers: Average price **300 USD**\n\n### Mobile device policy\n\nThe Mattermost mobile device policy enables the use of mobile devices for customer-facing roles, development, or those providing repeating on-call service in a secure fashion.\n\n#### Subscription\n\nIf you are using your personal device for business-related matters, we will reimburse up to 100 USD. In some countries/regions, reimbursement of a personal phone plan for business use is considered a taxable benefit. It is your responsibility to ensure that you comply with local tax laws when filing your taxes. Positions or roles where mobile reimbursement may be needed include the following:\n\n* Customer-facing roles:\n  * Account Executives\n  * Customer Success Managers\n  * Sales Leadership\n  * Customer Engineers\n* On-call roles:\n  * Software Design Engineer\n  * Build Engineer\n  * Security Engineer\n  * Site Reliability Engineer\n  * Support Engineers\n\nFor all other positions, we will reimburse up to 50 USD.\n\nIf you're unsure whether you qualify for a customer-facing role or on-call role, reach out to your manager and follow the [Manager Approval process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/staff-member-expenses/how-to-spend-company-money#manager-approval).\n\nThe company doesn't currently provide mobile device subscriptions in a centralized fashion. Subscriptions should be organized by the employee and expensed monthly. Mattermost recommends the usage of a monthly subscription model where possible.\n\n## Travel\n\nMattermost will cover work-related travel expenses for approved business travel. You may extend a business trip for personal reasons, but you will only be expensed for meals and lodging that are part of the business-related portion of the trip. Use the same Expense Guidelines when spending on air, lodging, and meals.\n\n### Meals and entertainment\n\nSpend company money like it\u2019s your own. When traveling on behalf of Mattermost, average meal costs will vary by destination city and country. The two links below are helpful reference points for city and country averages. Note: 20% is considered the maximum gratuity for exceptional service.\n\nThe below links provide a few examples regarding daily per diem guidance.\n\n* San Francisco 70 USD\n* New York 70 USD\n* Austin 55 USD\n* London 75 USD\n* Toronto 50 USD\n* Berlin 45 USD\n\nThe following links provide further detail regarding location-specific per diems:\n\n* [GSA annual per diem rates for the US](https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates/per-diem-rates-lookup)\n* [Foreign Per Diem Rates by Location administered by the US Department of State](https://aoprals.state.gov/web920/per_diem.asp)\n\nWhen dining with another staff member on one check, the most senior person is responsible for payment. When submitting your receipt in Expensify, include the names of all staff members who attended.\n\n### Airfare and traveling\n\nRefer to our separate policy [Mattermost Airfare and Traveling](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/airfare-and-traveling).\n\n### Hotel and lodging\n\nUse your best judgement when assessing hotel costs and proximity to your workplace or event. Similar to booking airfare, book lodging in advance whenever possible and optimize for cost, convenience, and safety of location. Due to potentially unforeseen circumstances causing a change in plans, it\u2019s advised not to pay in advance for your hotel accommodations.\n\nPlease spend company money as if it's your own. As always, security and safety is important and paramount for our staff members.\n\n#### Loyalty points\n\nStaff members may retain points earned for hotel stays. However, hotel reservations should optimize business needs and cost vs. points.\n\n### Mileage reimbursement\n\nWe will reimburse mileage according to local laws of the country in which your contract is legally signed. For example, a contract with Mattermost, Inc. would be subject to IRS mileage reimbursement at the [US rate per mile](http://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Standard-Mileage-Rates). For approval, you must add a screenshot of a map to the expense in Expensify indicating the mileage.\n\n* [US rate per mile](http://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Standard-Mileage-Rates)\n* [Canada rate per KM](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/benefits-allowances/automobile/automobile-motor-vehicle-allowances/automobile-allowance-rates.html)\n\n### Conferences and trade shows\n\n[Airfare](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#airfare-and-traveling), [Meals and Entertainment](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#meals-and-entertainment), and [Hotel](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#hotel-and-lodging) take precedence.\n\n### Team events, meetups, and off-sites\n\nTeam events and meetups should be planned in advance with ample notice and approval from your direct MLT.\n\nThe [Airfare](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#airfare-and-traveling), [Meals and Entertainment](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#meals-and-entertainment), and [Hotel](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#hotel-and-lodging) policies take precedence even in the case of team events or meetups.\n\nFor team off sites, where travel and overnight stays are necessary, we encourage staff to use their best judgment. Historically, the average cost is $250 USD per person per day which includes meals, lodging, and meeting spaces. Travel costs like airfare, ride shares, or external partner and customer dinners are considered an additional expenditure and should seek [manager approval](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/staff-member-expenses/how-to-spend-company-money#manager-approval) first.\n\n### Team celebrations\n\nThere will be times to celebrate with staff members, and we want you to. Please be sure to obtain approval from your department head by following the [Manager Approval](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/staff-member-expenses/how-to-spend-company-money#manager-approval) process.\n\n### Rideshares and rentals\n\nUse your best judgment if a rental car is needed. It's recommended to use Uber, Lyft, Taxis, or other cost-effective budget services. In certain instances, it may not be economical to do so and a rental car is necessary. Mattermost does not have a corporate account with any rental car agency at this time. Please continue to follow the spend principle \\(spend company money like it is your own money\\).\n\n### Frequently asked questions\n\n#### What happens if we need to cancel a reservation related to an internal travel (e.g. conference, customer meeting, team event) that\u2019s non-refundable? \n\nTry to get a refund, sometimes this is possible even if the vendor has a standard policy against it. Otherwise try to get credit for future use. If you\u2019re able to achieve either, or if the amount paid needs to be forfeited, please let finance know. Please expense any non-refundable charges for work-related reservations due to cancellations.\n\n#### If I didn\u2019t get a chance to submit an expense for work travel and are unable to get a refund for it, can I still have it reimbursed?\n\nYes, please submit work-related expenses [via Expensify](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/staff-member-expenses/how-to-use-expensify).\n\n#### I have a personal stay planned before/after my in-person work travel that was canceled. I was originally planning to have the company cover airfare costs to and from the destination. What are my options?\n\nYou can choose to continue your personal stay by covering your airfare cost out-of-pocket. Travel costs or UATP (United Air Travel Plan) for work meetings should be refunded to the company when possible. If a staff member was reimbursed for a company expense that\u2019s repurposed for personal use, the reimbursement should be [returned to the company](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/staff-member-expenses/how-to-reimburse-the-company). This is common for how most other companies are treating the separation between work travel and holiday travel. Alternatively, try to get a refund on any deposits for your personal stay, sometimes this is possible even if the vendor has a standard policy against it. Otherwise try to get credit for future use.\n\n#### If I decide to pay airfare and other work-related costs out-of-pocket for personal use, what is the timeline for paying back these expenses?\n\nPlease repay back to the company before using the work-related expense.\n\n#### Can credit from a canceled, non-refundable company reservation be gifted by the company to a staff member for personal use, such as a holiday, if the credit would otherwise expire and be unused (e.g. non-refundable air ticket)?\n\nNo. For a number of reasons, including complexity, compliance, and risk of self-dealing, our policy is to not gift credit from unused company expenses that would otherwise expire for personal use. Read [How we develop policies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hi-aQMwAxBJYjMjpVC6ZWa2Hb-vtluVjLep06FPNUCw/edit#) for more context.\n\n#### Can I use credit from a canceled, non-refundable company reservation for personal use, if the credit would otherwise expire and be unused? \n\nTo keep work and personal expenses separated, if a staff member receives a reimbursement for a work expense, which is then deployed for personal use, the reimbursement should be [returned to the company](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/staff-member-expenses/how-to-reimburse-the-company).\n\n\n## Other expenses\n\nThe company will reimburse for the following expenses if you need it for work or use it mainly for business, and local law allows us to pay for it without incurring taxes:\n\n**Flexible office space:** If working from home is not practical, you may rent out a co-working space at the expense of the company. This can include non-traditional spaces that require a membership as long as you average ~3 working days per week at the space. Any agreement must be between the team member and the co-working space \\(i.e. Mattermost will not sign or appear on the agreement\\). All expenses must be submitted through Expensify. The company will not be responsible for any expense that relates to office space subsequent to the termination of service between Mattermost and the staff member.\n\nFlexible office spaces or hot desk will be reviewed based on average costs for the city and location. That said, we expect an office space to not exceed 600 USD per month. If you are requesting to be reimbursed on a space that exceeds 600 USD per month, the [Manager Approval](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/staff-member-expenses/how-to-spend-company-money#manager-approval) process should be followed.\n\n**Professional development:** Work-related online courses and professional development certifications, not included in career path training or training for specialty roles, e.g. Information Security. Mattermost staff members are allotted 500 USD per fiscal year to spend on one or multiple training courses. [Manager Approval](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/staff-member-expenses/how-to-spend-company-money#manager-approval) is required for reimbursement greater than $500 USD.\n\n**Home internet:** Mattermost will reimburse up to 50 USD per month that can be expensed for home internet. If you are submitting an expense other than USD, please use the [Currency Exchange Rate Table](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/currency-exchange-table) to determine how much to expense each month. As always, expenses should be submitted in a [timely](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#preparing-and-submitting-expense-reports) manner and follow the [How to use Expensify](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#preparing-and-submitting-expense-reports) process.\n\n**Foreign currency reimbursement:** From time to time, you may receive an unfavorable exchange rate between the date you made the expense and the date Mattermost reimburses you. If that happens, Mattermost will make up the difference. To submit a foreign currency reimbursement claim, refer to [How to use Expensify](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#foreign-currency-reimbursement-submission). For the least amount of monetary impact, follow the [Company Guidelines](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#mattermost-guidelines) including submitting your expense in the period incurred.\n\n### Manager approval\n\nFor anything requiring manager approval, please complete the following steps:\n\n1. Reach out to your manager/department head regarding the approval.\n2. Give the business reason need and \\(if applicable\\) date/s if approval relates to an event or conference.\n3. If the manager approves this as legitimate business need, the manager is required to contact Finance for spending approval at [expenses@mattermost.com](mailto:expenses@mattermost.com).\n4. If/when approved, an approval email will be sent to the staff member and manager.\n5. Staff member must attach the approval to the Expensify expense report.\n\n",

It's recommended to use Uber, Lyft, Taxis, or other cost-effective budget services. In certain instances, it may not be economical to do so and a rental car is necessary. Mattermost does not have a corporate account with any rental car agency at this time. Please continue to follow the spend principle (spend company money like it is your own money).</p>\n<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>\n<h4>What happens if we need to cancel a reservation related to an internal travel (e.g. conference, customer meeting, team event) that\u2019s non-refundable?</h4>\n<p>Try to get a refund, sometimes this is possible even if the vendor has a standard policy against it. Otherwise try to get credit for future use. If you\u2019re able to achieve either, or if the amount paid needs to be forfeited, please let finance know. Please expense any non-refundable charges for work-related reservations due to cancellations.</p>\n<h4>If I didn\u2019t get a chance to submit an expense for work travel and are unable to get a refund for it, can I still have it reimbursed?</h4>\n<p>Yes, please submit work-related expenses <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/staff-member-expenses/how-to-use-expensify\">via Expensify</a>.</p>\n<h4>I have a personal stay planned before/after my in-person work travel that was canceled. I was originally planning to have the company cover airfare costs to and from the destination. What are my options?</h4>\n<p>You can choose to continue your personal stay by covering your airfare cost out-of-pocket. Travel costs or UATP (United Air Travel Plan) for work meetings should be refunded to the company when possible. If a staff member was reimbursed for a company expense that\u2019s repurposed for personal use, the reimbursement should be <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/staff-member-expenses/how-to-reimburse-the-company\">returned to the company</a>. This is common for how most other companies are treating the separation between work travel and holiday travel. Alternatively, try to get a refund on any deposits for your personal stay, sometimes this is possible even if the vendor has a standard policy against it. Otherwise try to get credit for future use.</p>\n<h4>If I decide to pay airfare and other work-related costs out-of-pocket for personal use, what is the timeline for paying back these expenses?</h4>\n<p>Please repay back to the company before using the work-related expense.</p>\n<h4>Can credit from a canceled, non-refundable company reservation be gifted by the company to a staff member for personal use, such as a holiday, if the credit would otherwise expire and be unused (e.g. non-refundable air ticket)?</h4>\n<p>No. For a number of reasons, including complexity, compliance, and risk of self-dealing, our policy is to not gift credit from unused company expenses that would otherwise expire for personal use. Read <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hi-aQMwAxBJYjMjpVC6ZWa2Hb-vtluVjLep06FPNUCw/edit#\">How we develop policies</a> for more context.</p>\n<h4>Can I use credit from a canceled, non-refundable company reservation for personal use, if the credit would otherwise expire and be unused?</h4>\n<p>To keep work and personal expenses separated, if a staff member receives a reimbursement for a work expense, which is then deployed for personal use, the reimbursement should be <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/staff-member-expenses/how-to-reimburse-the-company\">returned to the company</a>.</p>\n<h2>Other expenses</h2>\n<p>The company will reimburse for the following expenses if you need it for work or use it mainly for business, and local law allows us to pay for it without incurring taxes:</p>\n<p><strong>Flexible office space:</strong> If working from home is not practical, you may rent out a co-working space at the expense of the company. This can include non-traditional spaces that require a membership as long as you average ~3 working days per week at the space. Any agreement must be between the team member and the co-working space (i.e. Mattermost will not sign or appear on the agreement). All expenses must be submitted through Expensify. The company will not be responsible for any expense that relates to office space subsequent to the termination of service between Mattermost and the staff member.</p>\n<p>Flexible office spaces or hot desk will be reviewed based on average costs for the city and location. That said, we expect an office space to not exceed 600 USD per month. If you are requesting to be reimbursed on a space that exceeds 600 USD per month, the <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/staff-member-expenses/how-to-spend-company-money#manager-approval\">Manager Approval</a> process should be followed.</p>\n<p><strong>Professional development:</strong> Work-related online courses and professional development certifications, not included in career path training or training for specialty roles, e.g. Information Security. Mattermost staff members are allotted 500 USD per fiscal year to spend on one or multiple training courses. <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/staff-member-expenses/how-to-spend-company-money#manager-approval\">Manager Approval</a> is required for reimbursement greater than $500 USD.</p>\n<p><strong>Home internet:</strong> Mattermost will reimburse up to 50 USD per month that can be expensed for home internet. If you are submitting an expense other than USD, please use the <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/currency-exchange-table\">Currency Exchange Rate Table</a> to determine how much to expense each month. As always, expenses should be submitted in a <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#preparing-and-submitting-expense-reports\">timely</a> manner and follow the <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#preparing-and-submitting-expense-reports\">How to use Expensify</a> process.</p>\n<p><strong>Foreign currency reimbursement:</strong> From time to time, you may receive an unfavorable exchange rate between the date you made the expense and the date Mattermost reimburses you. If that happens, Mattermost will make up the difference. To submit a foreign currency reimbursement claim, refer to <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#foreign-currency-reimbursement-submission\">How to use Expensify</a>. For the least amount of monetary impact, follow the <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#mattermost-guidelines\">Company Guidelines</a> including submitting your expense in the period incurred.</p>\n<h3>Manager approval</h3>\n<p>For anything requiring manager approval, please complete the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reach out to your manager/department head regarding the approval.</li>\n<li>Give the business reason need and (if applicable) date/s if approval relates to an event or conference.</li>\n<li>If the manager approves this as legitimate business need, the manager is required to contact Finance for spending approval at <a href=\"mailto:expenses@mattermost.com\">expenses@mattermost.com</a>.</li>\n<li>If/when approved, an approval email will be sent to the staff member and manager.</li>\n<li>Staff member must attach the approval to the Expensify expense report.</li>\n</ol>",

Establish itself as a new team supporting post-sales & revenue retention, including AORs, processes & workflows.\n2. Completing the deployment of the Mattermost solution for Microsoft Teams in a customer environment.\n3. Completing a loadtest scenario of a Sev0 outage scenario in a customer environment, where up to 15,000 users logs in to the system within 15 minutes.\n\n## Areas of responsibility (AORs)\n\nThe team's primary mandate is to increase customer seats deployed, deeply understanding technical/engineering bottlenecks, and solving for them. Moreover, we are responsible for creating reference architectures, supporting non-standard deployments with complex technical problems, and providing engineering support to post-sales teams with >$50K customers on critical escalations, one-off custom solutions & integrations based on requirements defined by the CSMs/TAMs.\n\nA complete list of AORs is included below:\n\n1. **Customer Seats Deployed**: Seats deployed data for our customer base is [tracked in this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZnjJHWIsT9hIxotCYrSG66XIWsf_usf258Ll8HgVmzU/edit#gid=423031054)\n\n- **Technical onboarding**: Help customers deploy in non-standard environments, such as configuring and running loadtests, writing documentation for gold standard deployments, complex data migrations, integration configuration and setup, and guiding customers with deployment KPIs to measure long-term ROI.\n- **Server upgrades**: Support customers with non-standard server upgrades, run system integrity diagnostics before/after upgrade to detect anomalies, create database migration scripts in preparation for upgrades\n- **High scale documentation**: Enable successful customer deployments at scale, including amendments to deployment documentation, troubleshooting guides, how-to guides & videos, answers to general technical questions on the platform, Mattermost architecture diagrams, and documented deployment KPIs to measure long-term ROI.\n- **Customer health checks**: Ensure deployments meet recommendations, review performance metrics and share back with R&D to help improve loadtests\n\n2. **Reference Architectures**: In partnership with core platform team, with a [complete plan in this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kAxel327wsJwg35Y7EYNzHlbEnRN2Brn3Im9M4Rf82Q/edit#)\n\n- **Loadtest Deployment Tooling**: Create a script/guide (e.g. Terraform, Ansible, whitepaper) to automate the use of the loadtest framework, which includes AWS set up, keys, auth, and more. TAM team acts as the first customer, with the plan to support this script in other customer environments.\n- **ESR usage & ceiling tests**: Run usage & ceiling tests against ESRs (twice a year). Share observations to Server Platform teams and recommend architectural/docs changes, if any.\n- **Expand reference architectures**: Continue to expand on available reference architectures, with [GitLab\u2019s documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures/) as a north star\n\n3. **Custom Solutions**: _<Repository or page of custom solutions built for customers to be added>_\n\n- **Custom solutions**: Workarounds for unique requirements, one-off integrations (e.g. MS Teams integration), one-off solutions (e.g. legal hold).\n\n4. **Customer Escalations**:\n\n- **Technical line of defense for deployment escalations**: Ensure customer environments have what we need to help (e.g. system diagnostics, performance monitoring), perform deep troubleshooting and data collection, end-to-end handling of some incidents, escalate and partner with R&D for incidents that require more support.\n\nFor other references, see [this document for customer reliability engineering](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KS2Kt_gujCynK-Rl9vHN7zb6UfPe5kNeaUOYpQHMOcs/edit#), and [these slides for post-sales & revenue retention AORs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d00K-er3B15UFW9OkZrC0Y03htolYn6K874ZBucCAJo).\n\n## Links to key documents\n\n- Jira board: [https://mattermost.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/MM/boards/127](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/MM/boards/127)\n- Confluence page of deployment engineering solutions: [https://mattermost.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~557058c88c3d11b60143deaba6d3d018132127/pages/2461925377/Deployment+Engineering+Solutions](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~557058c88c3d11b60143deaba6d3d018132127/pages/2461925377/Deployment+Engineering+Solutions)\n- Deployed seats data: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZnjJHWIsT9hIxotCYrSG66XIWsf_usf258Ll8HgVmzU/edit#gid=423031054](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZnjJHWIsT9hIxotCYrSG66XIWsf_usf258Ll8HgVmzU/edit#gid=423031054)\n- Services request template: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EbP4Ab7N2hEAv--DRCcZHk0XtlG1MFP8F8F0viaTM7I/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EbP4Ab7N2hEAv--DRCcZHk0XtlG1MFP8F8F0viaTM7I/edit)\n\n## Deployment Engineering Knowledgebase\n\n### Performance Debugging Training Series (2023)\n\n- Elasticsearch Debugging & Design Best Practices: [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SYdDPLPvE) | [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-6AA15gfJLYzylfC1SQzmQw9h7WMOVi7ZIAtIBNufAk/edit?usp=sharing_eip_m&ts=636d10cc)\n- Job Progress Optimization: Deep Dive into Connections, Improvements & Query Analysis: [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8DiTNESnjI) | [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V6D96qXWesN_EnYDMTebKH6xS6I3zlmqEfq7Y8O6jMk/edit?usp=sharing)\n- Detecting Performance Monitoring Issues in Prometheus & Grafana: [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi9JlHf1eqY) | [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1STkcl2BLQMGwoDjgsUS5CQdVo-CGWgijltVH6biQzeE/edit#slide=id.ge9b7e537ec_0_0)\n- _Internal only:_ pprof, Grafana: [Zoom Video Recording](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/pl/bjo7ynua1fg8f876sm1umbbjyh) | [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10j3oY9Tx2e4Yn_6st-mfPennqN10V3MVy210NMNmTlI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n- [Trimming Operational Costs: Unveiling Mattermost\u2019s Cross-Cluster Migration](https://mattermost.com/blog/mattermosts-cross-cluster-migration/)\n- [Performance Debugging Training Series](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CO/pages/2388000769/Knowledge+Dump+Zone#Training)\n- [CNCF talk on using counters in Prometheus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67Ulrq6DxwA)\n- [Full source code for all metrics.go endpoints](https://github.com/mattermost/enterprise/blob/master/metrics/metrics.go)\n- [TAM Developer Training Call Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mdQtnIQsro8VjBW8K7esIdKuoEuhXWfYdTXcE6JvuhE/edit?usp=sharing)\n",

        "title": "Deployment Engineering: Frequently asked questions",
        "content": "# Deployment Engineering: Frequently asked questions\n\n## Why is this team important now?\n\nRetention is the #1 priority, and underdeployment is the leading cause for contraction. \n\nDeployment Engineering helps customer-facing teams (TAMs, CREs, CS) by leveraging engineering talent to accelerate customer success with deeper platform knowledge given their background in software design engineering, thus accelerating seat deploymets, thus reducing contraction, thus increasing renewal rates.\n\n## How is this team measured?\n\nPrimary measurement is **Customer Seats Deployed** - % of customers with >$50K ARR with at least 80% of seats deployed.\n\n## How will work be allocated to this team?\n\nDeployment Engineering will work closely with other post-sales teams (CREs, customer success, TAMs) to determine the highest impact technical customer priorities for the team to work on.\n\nFor instance, when choosing between three options, work will always be prioritized based on the impact level, with effort taken into consideration (e.g. a medium impact low effort technical priority may supersede a high impact but very high effort priority).\n\nMoreover, for any one-off customer solutions, a clear SOW or other such document will be created to set clear expectations with the customer of what is delivered, by whom, and in what timeframe, [outlined as a services request by the CSMs/TAMs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EbP4Ab7N2hEAv--DRCcZHk0XtlG1MFP8F8F0viaTM7I/edit), signed off by the customer. This process is similar to what would be done with a partner. The sign-off is not necessarily a formal contractual agreement, but at minimum a verbal agreement to ensure expectations are set clearly before work begins.\n\n## Who owns long-term maintenance of solutions built by this team?\n\nMost solutions should not require long-term maintenance, as they will be standalone scripts, plugins or other code that is not dependent on Mattermost server versions.\n\nFor solutions that require maintenance, we will discuss ownership between Deployment Engineering, TAMs, R&D and a vendor on a case-by-case basis.\n\n## How does this role differ from TAMs (Technical Account Managers)?\n\nTAMs are responsible for ongoing relationship management with technical champions, and own pre-defined customer onboarding in standard deployment environments (ie. follow our gold standard deployments).\n\nOn the other hand, Deployment Engineering supports non-standard deployments with complex technical problems, as well as work closely with customers on temporary one-off custom solutions & integrations based on [requirements outlined by the CSMs/TAMs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EbP4Ab7N2hEAv--DRCcZHk0XtlG1MFP8F8F0viaTM7I/edit).\n\nThus, Deployment Engineering acts as an extension of R&D supporting post-sales and customer success on the most complex, technical problems, with expertise on how to run and deploy Mattermost and the platform as a whole.\n\n## Why does this role not report to Customer Success, like TAMs?\n\nTAMs are responsible for ongoing relationship management, and are evaluated against renewal rates.\n\nDeployment Engineering engages with customers on a short-term basis, in a technical capacity. Their evaluation is not based on renewal rates, and hence do not directly report to the revenue organization (Sales & Customer Success).\n\n## How does this role differ from Customer Reliability Engineers?\n\nCustomer Reliability Engineers provide first-line of support & troubleshooting, and may fix bugs & security issues, while Deployment Engineering is a point of contact for critical deployment escalations only for customers over $50k ARR (e.g. performance degradation).\n\n## Why does this role not report to Customer Support, if they work on escalations?\n\nSupport Engineers are evaluated against CSAT scores and SLA coverage. Deployment Engineering is evaluated against Customer Seats Deployed.\n\n## Will this team be on call or part of SET rotation?\n\nNo.\n\n## What is out of scope for Deployment Engineering?\n\nThe following is out of scope for Deployment Engineering\n\n - Regular customer support (tier 1, 2, 3, 4 support) owned by Customer Support as per our standard support terms: https://mattermost.com/support-terms/ \n - Customer account management including expansion, renewals, or license management, owned by CSMs and TAMs.\n - Predefined onboarding journey including sales hand-off, standard deployments with standard data migrations, testing, training and end-user rollout, owned by TAMs unless specifically escalated to Deployment Engineering.\n - Identification of key integration opportunities for the Mattermost team to develop, owned by CSMs and TAMs\n - Development or maintenance of in-product features, integrations or other such product functionality, owned by R&D Engineering\n   - Note: In-product feature development may be completed by Deployment Engineering as an exception, e.g. building a custom solution that we decide to integrate into the product. Such a development requires prior approval from Product Engineering, to ensure they can support the feature once developed for the customer.\n",

The sign-off is not necessarily a formal contractual agreement, but at minimum a verbal agreement to ensure expectations are set clearly before work begins.</p>\n<h2>Who owns long-term maintenance of solutions built by this team?</h2>\n<p>Most solutions should not require long-term maintenance, as they will be standalone scripts, plugins or other code that is not dependent on Mattermost server versions.</p>\n<p>For solutions that require maintenance, we will discuss ownership between Deployment Engineering, TAMs, R&amp;D and a vendor on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<h2>How does this role differ from TAMs (Technical Account Managers)?</h2>\n<p>TAMs are responsible for ongoing relationship management with technical champions, and own pre-defined customer onboarding in standard deployment environments (ie. follow our gold standard deployments).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Deployment Engineering supports non-standard deployments with complex technical problems, as well as work closely with customers on temporary one-off custom solutions &amp; integrations based on <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EbP4Ab7N2hEAv--DRCcZHk0XtlG1MFP8F8F0viaTM7I/edit\">requirements outlined by the CSMs/TAMs</a>.</p>\n<p>Thus, Deployment Engineering acts as an extension of R&amp;D supporting post-sales and customer success on the most complex, technical problems, with expertise on how to run and deploy Mattermost and the platform as a whole.</p>\n<h2>Why does this role not report to Customer Success, like TAMs?</h2>\n<p>TAMs are responsible for ongoing relationship management, and are evaluated against renewal rates.</p>\n<p>Deployment Engineering engages with customers on a short-term basis, in a technical capacity. Their evaluation is not based on renewal rates, and hence do not directly report to the revenue organization (Sales &amp; Customer Success).</p>\n<h2>How does this role differ from Customer Reliability Engineers?</h2>\n<p>Customer Reliability Engineers provide first-line of support &amp; troubleshooting, and may fix bugs &amp; security issues, while Deployment Engineering is a point of contact for critical deployment escalations only for customers over $50k ARR (e.g. performance degradation).</p>\n<h2>Why does this role not report to Customer Support, if they work on escalations?</h2>\n<p>Support Engineers are evaluated against CSAT scores and SLA coverage. Deployment Engineering is evaluated against Customer Seats Deployed.</p>\n<h2>Will this team be on call or part of SET rotation?</h2>\n<p>No.</p>\n<h2>What is out of scope for Deployment Engineering?</h2>\n<p>The following is out of scope for Deployment Engineering</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regular customer support (tier 1, 2, 3, 4 support) owned by Customer Support as per our standard support terms: https://mattermost.com/support-terms/ </li>\n<li>Customer account management including expansion, renewals, or license management, owned by CSMs and TAMs.</li>\n<li>Predefined onboarding journey including sales hand-off, standard deployments with standard data migrations, testing, training and end-user rollout, owned by TAMs unless specifically escalated to Deployment Engineering.</li>\n<li>Identification of key integration opportunities for the Mattermost team to develop, owned by CSMs and TAMs</li>\n<li>Development or maintenance of in-product features, integrations or other such product functionality, owned by R&amp;D Engineering</li>\n<li>Note: In-product feature development may be completed by Deployment Engineering as an exception, e.g. building a custom solution that we decide to integrate into the product. Such a development requires prior approval from Product Engineering, to ensure they can support the feature once developed for the customer.</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "# Localization\n\nThe goal of the localization process is to consistently produce high quality translations release after release through collaboration between the international community, translators, project managers, language leads, and the core team.\n\n## Translation Process\n\nIf you're interested in contributing translations to Mattermost, please join the [Mattermost localization channel to discuss](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/localization). Below are descriptions of the overall localization process.\n\n## Initial Translation\n\nTo translate a language:\n\n1. Join the [Mattermost Translation Server](http://translate.mattermost.com).\n2. Check whether the language you want to help translate is listed in the [Translation Server](https://translate.mattermost.com/projects/).\n\n   * If it is, perhaps offer to help translate or review and make suggestions.\n   * If not, ask to setup your language on the [Mattermost localization channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/localization), so you can start helping with the translation.\n\n   **Note:** Languages are grouped either as \"shipped\" or \"work in progress\". A language [ships in Mattermost](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/settings/account-settings.html#language) if it meets specified translation quality.\n\n3. Review translation rules written by localization leads, when applicable:\n   * [German \\(Regeln zur \u00dcbersetzung von Mattermost\\)](https://gist.github.com/der-test/6e04bff8a173e053811cb93e08838ca2).\n   * [French \\(R\u00e8gles pour la traduction francophone de Mattermost\\)](https://github.com/wget/mattermost-localization-french-translation-rules).\n   * [Dutch translation rules for Mattermost](https://github.com/ctlaltdieliet/mattermost-localization-dutch-translation-rules).\n\n## Translation Updates\n\n1. New and updated source strings are automatically added to the translation server each time a GitHub pull request containing string changes is merged.\n2. A new pull request with latest translations that reach at least Beta quality is submitted to the [mattermost-mobile](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile), [mattermost-server](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server), and [mattermost-webapp](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp) repos each Monday at 22:00 GMT.\n   * A pull request will also be submitted on the day of major feature complete and code complete to ensure latest translations are included in the release.\n   * A pull request may also be submitted for a release candidate.\n\n**Important:** Please do **not** submit translations directly via a pull request as they may be lost with the next pull request update from the Mattermost Translation Server.\n\n## Translation Quality\n\nIn order for users to understand the accuracy and coverage of language translations, quality levels are explicitly defined for each language:\n\n### Official\n\n* 100% of translation verified by someone deeply knowledgeable in Mattermost functionality.\n* 100% of translation verified by someone deeply knowledgeable in target language.\n* No translation may be out-of-date due to changes to English-language text since the last translation and review cycle.\n* Language must have at least one official reviewer who maintains the language with updated strings imported to the [Translation Server](http://translate.mattermost.com) over time.\n* Language must have been in use for **at least three full release cycles** where end users in target language can share feedback and corrections.\n\nOfficial languages are listed in **Account Settings &gt; Display &gt; Language**.\n\n### Beta\n\n* 90% of translation verified by someone deeply knowledgeable in Mattermost functionality and in the target language.\n* Up to 10% of translation may be out-of-date due to changes to English-language text since the last translation and review cycle.\n\nBeta languages are listed in **Account Settings &gt; Display &gt; Language** appended with **\\(Beta\\)**.\n\n### Alpha\n\n* Translation has not yet reached Beta quality.\n\nAn official language may be changed back to Beta or Alpha if the specified requirements are not met for a release. Similarly, Beta languages may be dropped back to Alpha.\n\n## Message Syntax\n\nTo format localized messages, [mattermost-webapp](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp) uses the [react-intl](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl), a Javascript library from [FormatJS](https://formatjs.io). This library uses the [ICU Message syntax](http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/messages), which is the standard syntax for many programming languages.\n\nIf you don't know about the ICU syntax, please familiarize yourself by reading the [ICU Message Syntax simplified documentation](https://formatjs.io/docs/core-concepts/icu-syntax/) and [Formatting Messages](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/format_parse/messages/). What's most important here is to read the sections dedicated to how plural terms are managed.\n\nIn order to ease the manipulation of strings like these with a special syntax \\(ICU as a reminder\\), a developer has created an online tool allowing to test an ICU string. This tool, called [Online ICU Message Editor](https://format-message.github.io/icu-message-format-for-translators/editor.html), is displayed as a live editor previewing how a string will appear in context. This tool has been reported by some members of our community as really helpful to translate strings containing an ICU syntax. Don't hesitate to use it.\n\n## Knowledge Base\n\nSome terms used in Mattermost may be technical. If you don't know how to translate a specific term:\n\n* If applicable, check how the term has been translated in other locations of the translation you are contributing to.\n* Use a translation engine to know how others have translated the term.\n* Use the [Microsoft open linguistic portal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/language/Search).\n* Ask your question on the [Mattermost localization channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/localization).\n\n## Test Translations\n\nIf you'd like to review and verify translations prior to achieving Beta quality status, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Build Mattermost on your machine following the [Developer Machine Setup Guides](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/dev-setup.html).\n2. Download a copy of your translations to your local machine by going to the language of your choice, e.g. [German](https://translate.mattermost.com/projects/mattermost/mattermost-server_master/de/), then **Files &gt; Download original translation file \\(go-i18n JSON file\\)**.\n3. Copy the generated `[locale].json` files to the corresponding directories:\n   * For the server, copy the files to the i18n directory of the `mattermost-server` project.\n   * For the webapp, copy the files to the i18n directory of the `mattermost-webapp` project.\n4. Modify the file `i18n/i18n.jsx` in the `mattermost-webapp` project to include your translated strings.\n5. Compile and run **Mattermost** to confirm everything works. You can then review and verify translations from your machine.\n\nIf you find a string that has not been translated, search for the string in the respective localization file to confirm it's included for translations. You can find the English version for server, webapp, and mobile projects below:\n\n* [https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/blob/master/i18n/en.json](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/blob/master/i18n/en.json)\n* [https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp/blob/master/i18n/en.json](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp/blob/master/i18n/en.json)\n* [https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/assets/base/i18n/en.json](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/assets/base/i18n/en.json)\n\nIf it\u2019s included in the file, then most likely it hasn't been translated yet, but is in [https://translate.mattermost.com](https://translate.mattermost.com). If you want to confirm whether it's translated, you can check for the respective `.json file` in the `/i18n` folder.\n\n## Translation Maintenance\n\nTranslations require updates on a monthly basis as features are added and changed.\n\nWhile the formal process for updates has yet to be determined, currently the Release Manager notifies one of the official translation reviewers who then forwards the message to the community of translators. This reminder tends to induce a virtuous cycle of motivation into the community of translators.\n\nBelow are current official reviewers and maintainers for languages that have reached at least Beta-quality. Official reviewers submit final translations for languages; maintainers suggest translations and step in when official reviewers aren't able to help in a certain release.\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to the process, please join the [Mattermost localization channel to discuss](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/localization). Creating localization channels is also encouraged - see examples of current channels including [Italian](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/i18n-italian), [German](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/i18n-german), and [Swedish](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/i18n-swedish).\n\n| Language | Official Reviewer\\(s\\) | Maintainers |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Deutsch - German | TBD \\(Open Role\\) |  |\n| English - Australian | [Matthew Williams \\(matthew.williams\\)](https://translate.mattermost.com/user/matthew-w/) |  |\n| Espa\u00f1ol - Spanish | [Elias Nahum \\(enahum\\)](https://github.com/enahum) | [Jes\u00fas Espino \\(jespino\\)](https://github.com/jespino) |\n| Fran\u00e7ais - French | [William Gathoye \\(wget\\)](https://github.com/wget) |  |\n| Magyar - Hungarian | [Zsolt God\u00f3 \\(sakaitsu\\)](https://translate.mattermost.com/user/sakaitsu) | [Csaba T\u00f3th \\(tsabi\\)](https://translate.mattermost.com/user/tsabi) |\n| Italiano - Italian | [Michael Longo \\(mlongo4290\\)](https://github.com/mlongo4290) | [Ema Panz \\(thepanz\\)](https://github.com/thepanz) |\n| \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e - Japanese | [Yusuke Nemoto \\(kaakaa\\)](https://github.com/kaakaa) |  |\n| \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 - Korean | TBD \\(Open Role\\) |  |\n| Nederlands - Dutch | [Tom De Moor \\(ctlaltdieliet\\)](https://github.com/ctlaltdieliet) |  |\n| Polski - Poland | [Daniel Burzmi\u0144ski \\(hectorskypl\\)](https://github.com/hectorskypl) | [Tomasz Gruca \\(gruceqq\\)](https://translate.mattermost.com/user/gruceqq) |\n| Portugu\u00eas do Brasil - Portuguese | [Rodrigo Corsi \\(rodcorsi\\)](https://github.com/rodcorsi) | [Carlos Tadeu Panato Junior \\(cpanato\\)](https://github.com/cpanato) |\n| Rom\u00e2n\u0103 - Romanian | [Nikolai Zahariev \\(nikolaiz\\)](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/tree/6ad420f58201eaf6d7823abe67ec7f3201ce59a8/contributors/contributors/translate.mattermost.com/user/nikolaiz/README.md) |  |\n| Svenska - Swedish | [Martin Johnson \\(johnsonbrothers\\)](https://github.com/johnsonbrothers) |  |\n| T\u00fcrk\u00e7e - Turkish | [Kaya Zeren \\(kaya\\_zeren\\)](https://twitter.com/kaya_zeren) |  |\n| P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 - Russian | [Alexey Napalkov \\(flynbit\\)](https://github.com/flynbit) |  |\n| Y\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 - Ukrainian | TBD \\(Open Role\\) |  |\n| \u4e2d\u6587 \\(\u7b80\u4f53\\) - Simplified Chinese | [aeomin \\(aeomin\\)](http://translate.mattermost.com/user/aeomin) |  |\n| \u4e2d\u6587 \\(\u7e41\u9ad4\\) - Traditional Chinese | [Tze-Kei Lee \\(chikei\\)](https://github.com/chikei) |  |\n\n## Administrative Tasks\n\nTo grant trusted translators additional permissions as Weblate admin, add the user to the `mattermost@TrustedReviewers` group in Weblate:\n\n1.

What's most important here is to read the sections dedicated to how plural terms are managed.</p>\n<p>In order to ease the manipulation of strings like these with a special syntax (ICU as a reminder), a developer has created an online tool allowing to test an ICU string. This tool, called <a href=\"https://format-message.github.io/icu-message-format-for-translators/editor.html\">Online ICU Message Editor</a>, is displayed as a live editor previewing how a string will appear in context. This tool has been reported by some members of our community as really helpful to translate strings containing an ICU syntax. Don't hesitate to use it.</p>\n<h2>Knowledge Base</h2>\n<p>Some terms used in Mattermost may be technical. If you don't know how to translate a specific term:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If applicable, check how the term has been translated in other locations of the translation you are contributing to.</li>\n<li>Use a translation engine to know how others have translated the term.</li>\n<li>Use the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/language/Search\">Microsoft open linguistic portal</a>.</li>\n<li>Ask your question on the <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/localization\">Mattermost localization channel</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Test Translations</h2>\n<p>If you'd like to review and verify translations prior to achieving Beta quality status, you can follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Build Mattermost on your machine following the <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/dev-setup.html\">Developer Machine Setup Guides</a>.</li>\n<li>Download a copy of your translations to your local machine by going to the language of your choice, e.g. <a href=\"https://translate.mattermost.com/projects/mattermost/mattermost-server_master/de/\">German</a>, then <strong>Files &gt; Download original translation file (go-i18n JSON file)</strong>.</li>\n<li>Copy the generated <code>[locale].json</code> files to the corresponding directories:</li>\n<li>For the server, copy the files to the i18n directory of the <code>mattermost-server</code> project.</li>\n<li>For the webapp, copy the files to the i18n directory of the <code>mattermost-webapp</code> project.</li>\n<li>Modify the file <code>i18n/i18n.jsx</code> in the <code>mattermost-webapp</code> project to include your translated strings.</li>\n<li>Compile and run <strong>Mattermost</strong> to confirm everything works. You can then review and verify translations from your machine.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you find a string that has not been translated, search for the string in the respective localization file to confirm it's included for translations. You can find the English version for server, webapp, and mobile projects below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/blob/master/i18n/en.json\">https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/blob/master/i18n/en.json</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp/blob/master/i18n/en.json\">https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp/blob/master/i18n/en.json</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/assets/base/i18n/en.json\">https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/assets/base/i18n/en.json</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If it\u2019s included in the file, then most likely it hasn't been translated yet, but is in <a href=\"https://translate.mattermost.com\">https://translate.mattermost.com</a>. If you want to confirm whether it's translated, you can check for the respective <code>.json file</code> in the <code>/i18n</code> folder.</p>\n<h2>Translation Maintenance</h2>\n<p>Translations require updates on a monthly basis as features are added and changed.</p>\n<p>While the formal process for updates has yet to be determined, currently the Release Manager notifies one of the official translation reviewers who then forwards the message to the community of translators. This reminder tends to induce a virtuous cycle of motivation into the community of translators.</p>\n<p>Below are current official reviewers and maintainers for languages that have reached at least Beta-quality. Official reviewers submit final translations for languages; maintainers suggest translations and step in when official reviewers aren't able to help in a certain release.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in contributing to the process, please join the <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/localization\">Mattermost localization channel to discuss</a>. Creating localization channels is also encouraged - see examples of current channels including <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/i18n-italian\">Italian</a>, <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/i18n-german\">German</a>, and <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/i18n-swedish\">Swedish</a>.</p>\n<p>| Language | Official Reviewer(s) | Maintainers |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Deutsch - German | TBD (Open Role) |  |\n| English - Australian | <a href=\"https://translate.mattermost.com/user/matthew-w/\">Matthew Williams (matthew.williams)</a> |  |\n| Espa\u00f1ol - Spanish | <a href=\"https://github.com/enahum\">Elias Nahum (enahum)</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/jespino\">Jes\u00fas Espino (jespino)</a> |\n| Fran\u00e7ais - French | <a href=\"https://github.com/wget\">William Gathoye (wget)</a> |  |\n| Magyar - Hungarian | <a href=\"https://translate.mattermost.com/user/sakaitsu\">Zsolt God\u00f3 (sakaitsu)</a> | <a href=\"https://translate.mattermost.com/user/tsabi\">Csaba T\u00f3th (tsabi)</a> |\n| Italiano - Italian | <a href=\"https://github.com/mlongo4290\">Michael Longo (mlongo4290)</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/thepanz\">Ema Panz (thepanz)</a> |\n| \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e - Japanese | <a href=\"https://github.com/kaakaa\">Yusuke Nemoto (kaakaa)</a> |  |\n| \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 - Korean | TBD (Open Role) |  |\n| Nederlands - Dutch | <a href=\"https://github.com/ctlaltdieliet\">Tom De Moor (ctlaltdieliet)</a> |  |\n| Polski - Poland | <a href=\"https://github.com/hectorskypl\">Daniel Burzmi\u0144ski (hectorskypl)</a> | <a href=\"https://translate.mattermost.com/user/gruceqq\">Tomasz Gruca (gruceqq)</a> |\n| Portugu\u00eas do Brasil - Portuguese | <a href=\"https://github.com/rodcorsi\">Rodrigo Corsi (rodcorsi)</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/cpanato\">Carlos Tadeu Panato Junior (cpanato)</a> |\n| Rom\u00e2n\u0103 - Romanian | <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/tree/6ad420f58201eaf6d7823abe67ec7f3201ce59a8/contributors/contributors/translate.mattermost.com/user/nikolaiz/README.md\">Nikolai Zahariev (nikolaiz)</a> |  |\n| Svenska - Swedish | <a href=\"https://github.com/johnsonbrothers\">Martin Johnson (johnsonbrothers)</a> |  |\n| T\u00fcrk\u00e7e - Turkish | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaya_zeren\">Kaya Zeren (kaya_zeren)</a> |  |\n| P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 - Russian | <a href=\"https://github.com/flynbit\">Alexey Napalkov (flynbit)</a> |  |\n| Y\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 - Ukrainian | TBD (Open Role) |  |\n| \u4e2d\u6587 (\u7b80\u4f53) - Simplified Chinese | <a href=\"http://translate.mattermost.com/user/aeomin\">aeomin (aeomin)</a> |  |\n| \u4e2d\u6587 (\u7e41\u9ad4) - Traditional Chinese | <a href=\"https://github.com/chikei\">Tze-Kei Lee (chikei)</a> |  |</p>\n<h2>Administrative Tasks</h2>\n<p>To grant trusted translators additional permissions as Weblate admin, add the user to the <code>mattermost@TrustedReviewers</code> group in Weblate:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select <strong>Admin interface</strong> (tool icon in Weblate header).</li>\n<li>Go to <strong>Users &gt; Django Admin Interface</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select the user you want to grant permissions to.</li>\n<li>Go to <strong>Groups</strong>.</li>\n<li>Add the user to the <code>mattermost@TrustedReviewers</code> group.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Save</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To add a new language:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <a href=\"https://translate.mattermost.com/projects/i18n-wip\">https://translate.mattermost.com/projects/i18n-wip</a>.</li>\n<li>Select any of the components on the resulting page, then select <strong>Tools &gt; Start new translation</strong>. </li>\n<li>Select the languages you want to add, then <strong>Start new translation</strong>.</li>\n<li>Repeat step 2 for every component in <a href=\"https://translate.mattermost.com/projects/i18n-wip\">https://translate.mattermost.com/projects/i18n-wip</a>.</li>\n</ol>",

        "content": "# Localization\n\nThe goal of the localization process is to consistently produce high quality translations release after release through collaboration between the international community, translators, project managers, language leads, and the core team.\n\n## Interested in contributing to product translations?\n\nIf you're interested in contributing translations to Mattermost, learn more about getting started with Mattermost translations by visiting the [translation contribution](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/why-contribute/#you-want-to-help-with-product-translation) documentation. \n\n### Join us on the Mattermost Community server\n\nWe strongly encourage all translators to join us in the [Mattermost localization channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/localization) on the Mattermost Community server. \n\nIn the localization channel, you can:\n- Discuss translation questions, concerns, and best practices with both Mattermost staff and the Mattermost translation community.\n- Learn more about string context, including audience and product area.\n- Review important translation timelines, deadlines, announcements, and notifications.\n- Escalate any challenges you're experiencing as a product translator.\n\n**Tip:** We also encourage language experts to create language-specific localization channels on the Mattermost Community Server. See examples of current channels including [Italian](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/i18n-italian), [German](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/i18n-german), and [Swedish](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/i18n-swedish).\n\n### Active translation projects\n\nYou can contribute to the following active translation projects:\n\n| **Translation project** | **Translation server URL** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Channels | https://translate.mattermost.com/projects/mattermost/ |\n| Playbooks | https://translate.mattermost.com/projects/playbooks/ |\n| Desktop app | https://translate.mattermost.com/projects/mattermost/mattermost-desktop/ |\n| Mobile app | https://translate.mattermost.com/projects/mattermost/mattermost-mobile-v2/ |\n| Calls | https://translate.mattermost.com/projects/calls/ |\n\n\nThe general localization process is described in the following sections on this page. \n\n## Translate English product strings into additional languages\n\nMattermost is developed in US English, and officially supports 20 additional languages. Getting started is easy.\n\n### Join the [Mattermost translation server](https://translate.mattermost.com)\n\n**Important note:** While it's common to contribute to Mattermost in GitHub, product translations is a notable exception. You must contribute to Mattermost translations on the Mattermost translation server. Please don't attempt to submit translations in GitHub via pull requests (PRs) as your translations will be overwritten with the next PR update.\n\n### Confirm whether the language you want to translate is one we officially support or is a work-in-progress (WIP) language. To contribute to the supported languages you need extra permissions, this is a safety measure. \nRequesting these permissions can be done in the [Mattermost localization channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/localization) or with a direct message to Carrie Warner or Tom De Moor.\n\nOnly supported languages are available in-product by selecting **Settings > Display > Language**. Any language that isn't officially supported is considered a work-in-progress language. Work-in-progress languages become officially supported languages when the following two conditions are met:\n* The (WIP) language reaches or exceeds the Beta translation quality threshold across three consecutive releases; and,\n* A language expert is available for at least six months of maintenance updates.\n\nSee the section on [translation quality](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/localization#translation-quality) for further details.\n\n**Tip:** We encourage translators to help us support additional languages and regional variants.\n\n### Review translation rules written by localization leads, when applicable\n\nTranslation rules and glossaries are available for the following languages:\n\n   * [German \\(Regeln zur \u00dcbersetzung von Mattermost\\)](https://gist.github.com/der-test/6e04bff8a173e053811cb93e08838ca2).\n   * [French \\(R\u00e8gles pour la traduction francophone de Mattermost\\)](https://github.com/wget/mattermost-localization-french-translation-rules).\n   * [Dutch translation rules for Mattermost](https://github.com/ctlaltdieliet/mattermost-localization-dutch-translation-rules).\n\n**Tip:** We welcome rules and guidelines for all supported languages. If these translation assets don't exist for the language you're interested in, perhaps you'd be open to help create them?\n\n## Omit error strings from localization process\n\nWhen an error string isn\u2019t visible to end users, engineering teams must use ``model.NoTranslation`` as the error id to implement a ``model.AppError`` without a translation. See examples of this approach in the [mattermost/mattermost-server](https://translate.mattermost.com/projects/mattermost/server/) repository on GitHub.\n\nError strings that use ``model.NoTranslation`` as the error id are omitted from Mattermost translation workflows, and aren't surfaced up in Weblate to translators.\n\n## Product localization process\n\nThe following flow diagram outlines the product localization flow from the translation server to the Mattermost codebase:\n\n![Mattermost product localization flow diagram](../../../.gitbook/assets/i18n-flow.png)\n\n1. New and updated US English source strings are automatically added to the translation server each time a GitHub PR containing string changes is merged by Mattermost Engineering.\n2. The translation server pulls the latest string changes as they are committed to the codebase.\n3. Translators are notified when strings are new or changed.\n4. Translators add and update string translations.\n5. Each Monday, at 22:00 GMT, a job opens PRs in GitHub to the main branches of the [mattermost-server and mattermost-webapp](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/), [mattermost-mobile](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/), and [mattermost-desktop](https://github.com/mattermost/desktop) repositories. Weekly PRs contain several commits, one per modified language. Changes are merged back into each branch after a security/consistency review. \n\nPRs will also be submitted on the day of major feature complete, code complete, and release candidates to ensure latest translations are included in the release.\n\n## Translation PR review process\n\nTranslation PRs are created automatically on Mondays. These PRs are also posted to the [i18n PRs channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/i18n-prs). Engineering PR reviews focus on ensuring that unexpected characters aren't injected into strings. If security concerns are found, Engineering notifies the Security team.\n\nThe translation PRs should be reviewed and merged as soon as possible to avoid blocking translators. \n\n**Important Note:** Engineering teams must merge these PRs into the codebase using \"merge commit\" (technically also known as \"rebase and merge\"), and /never/ \"squash and commit\". The latter breaks the automated translation server flow, locks the translations, and forces manual fixes.\n\n### Cherry-pick translation PRs to release branches\n\nAmy Blais will notify the team if the PR should be cherry-picked to a release branch (e.g. ``release x.x``).\n\nPR review owners:\n  - Server translations PRs - Owner: Tom De Moor\n  - Mobile translations PRs - Owner: Tom De Moor\n  - Desktop app translations PRs - Owner: Devin\n\n## Translation quality\n\nIn order for users to understand the accuracy and coverage of language translations, quality levels are explicitly defined for each language as one of: Official, Beta, or Alpha.\n\n### Official\n\n* 100% of translation verified by someone deeply knowledgeable in Mattermost functionality.\n* 100% of translation verified by someone deeply knowledgeable in target language.\n* No translation may be out-of-date due to changes to English-language text since the last translation and review cycle.\n* Language must have at least one official reviewer who maintains the language with updated strings imported to the [Translation Server](https://translate.mattermost.com) over time.\n* Language must have been in use for **at least three full release cycles** where end users in target language can share feedback and corrections.\n\nOfficial languages are listed in **Account Settings &gt; Display &gt; Language**.\n\n### Beta\n\n* At least 90% of string translation verified by someone deeply knowledgeable in Mattermost functionality and in the target language. Languages at risk for ongoing maintenance can require a higher translation threshold closer to 100%.\n* Up to 10% of translation may be out-of-date due to changes to English-language text since the last translation and review cycle.\n\nBeta languages are listed in **Account Settings &gt; Display &gt; Language** appended with **\\(Beta\\)**.\n\n### Alpha\n\n* Translation has not yet reached Beta quality. An official language may be changed back to Beta or Alpha if the specified requirements are not met for a release. Similarly, Beta languages may be dropped back to Alpha.\n\nAlpha languages are listed in **Account Settings &gt; Display &gt; Language** appended with **\\(Alpha\\)**.\n\n## Message syntax\n\n[react-intl](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl) is used to format localized messages in React packages of [mattermost](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server). This library uses the ICU MessageFormat syntax, which is a Unicode standard used in many programming languages.\n\n[ICU Message syntax guide](https://formatjs.io/docs/core-concepts/icu-syntax/) is a good resource to familiarize yourself with. What's most important here is to read the sections dedicated to Quoting/Escaping, and how placeholders are managed, including placeholder arguments such as `plural`, `select`, `number`, and so on.\n\nThe [Mattermost translation server](https://translate.mattermost.com) will automatically check and validate translations in the editor. If there are any failing checks, you will want to review them to spot any potential typos or errors. These checks can be quite helpful in spotting subtle issues in long or more complex translation strings.\n\nAdditionally, [Online ICU Message Editor](https://format-message.github.io/icu-message-format-for-translators/editor.html) is a good resource that supports live-editing. It's great for previewing how a string will appear in context, don't hesitate to use it.\n\n## Resources for translating technical terms\n\nSome terms used in Mattermost may be technical. If you don't know how to translate a specific term:\n\n* Where applicable, review how the term has been translated in other locations of the translation you are contributing to.\n* Where applicable, review machine translation suggestions provided via the Deep-L integration.\n* Use a translation engine to learn how others have translated the term.\n* Use the [Microsoft open linguistic portal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/language/Search).\n* Ask your question in the [Mattermost localization channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/localization).\n\n## Test translations\n\nA [Mattermost Cloud workspace](https://localization.cloud.mattermost.com/) is available for all Mattermost translators to understand string context, including the target user and the task the user is performing when they encounter the string. This workspace is updated weekly; however, translations can lag behind Cloud releases by up to two weeks.\n\n### Missed translations\n\nIf you encounter a product string that hasn't yet been translated in the Mattermost Cloud workspace, the string is either not yet translated, or the workspace hasn't been updated yet to include that translated string. \n\nYou can search for strings in the English localization resource file within a respective GitHub repository to confirm whether a missed translation or an outdated workspace. The following resource files are available for US English strings:\n\n* [mattermost-server and mattermost-webapp](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/blob/master/i18n/en.json)\n* [mattermost-mobile](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/assets/base/i18n/en.json)\n* [mattermost-desktop](https://github.com/mattermost/desktop/blob/master/i18n/en.json)\n\nEach Mattermost GitHub repository above will contain additional resource files for each supported language. If a string appears in the `en.json` file, but displays in English in a localized resource file, that string likely isn't translated yet. An English string in the `en.json` file that is translated in its associated localized resource file likely indicates that the workspace hasn't been updated yet to include that translation.\n\nIf you discover a missing translation, please let us know in the [Mattermost localization channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/localization). \n\n## Translation maintenance\n\nProduct translations require updates on a monthly basis as features are added and changed. Weekly updates and deadlines are announced in the [Mattermost localization channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/localization).\n\nBelow are current official reviewers and maintainers for officially supported languages. Official reviewers submit final translations for languages; maintainers suggest translations and step in when official reviewers aren't able to help in a certain release.\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to the process, please join the [Mattermost localization channel to discuss](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/localization). \n\n| Language | Official Reviewer\\(s\\) | Maintainers |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Bulgarian | TBD (Open role) | TBD (Open role) |\n| Deutsch - German | [JtheBAB \\(jthebab\\)](https://translate.mattermost.com/user/JtheBAB/) | [Jan-Peter Rusch \\(jprusch\\)](https://translate.mattermost.com/user/jprusch/) |\n| English - Australian | [Matthew Williams \\(matthew.williams\\)](https://translate.mattermost.com/user/matthew-w/) | TBD (Open role) |\n| Espa\u00f1ol - Spanish | TBD (Open role) | TBD (Open role) |\n| Fran\u00e7ais - French | TBD (Open role) | TBD (Open role) |\n| Magyar - Hungarian | TBD (Open role) | TBD (Open role) |\n| Italiano - Italian | TBD (Open role) | TBD (Open role) |\n| \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e - Japanese | [Yusuke Nemoto \\(kaakaa\\)](https://github.com/kaakaa) | TBD (Open role) |\n| \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 - Korean | TBD \\(Open role\\) | TBD (Open role) |\n| Nederlands - Dutch | [Tom De Moor \\(ctlaltdieliet\\)](https://github.com/ctlaltdieliet) | TBD (Open role) |\n| Polski - Poland | [Master7 \\(markar\\)](https://translate.mattermost.com/user/Master7) | TBD (Open role) |\n| Portugu\u00eas do Brasil - Portuguese | TBD (Open role) | TBD (Open role) |\n| Rom\u00e2n\u0103 - Romanian | TBD \\(Open Role\\) | TBD (Open role) |\n| Svenska - Swedish | [Martin Johnson \\(johnsonbrothers\\)](https://github.com/johnsonbrothers) | TBD (Open role) |\n| T\u00fcrk\u00e7e - Turkish | [Kaya Zeren \\(kaya\\_zeren\\)](https://twitter.com/kaya_zeren) | TBD (Open role) |\n| P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 - Russian | [Konstantin Talalov \\(eleferen\\)](https://translate.mattermost.com/user/Eleferen/) | TBD (Open role) |\n| Y\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 - Ukrainian | TBD \\(Open role\\) | TBD (Open role) |\n| \u4e2d\u6587 \\(\u7b80\u4f53\\) - Simplified Chinese | [Sharuru \\(Sharuru\\)](https://translate.mattermost.com/user/Sharuru) | [ThrRip \\(ThrRip\\)](https://translate.mattermost.com/user/ThrRip) |\n| \u4e2d\u6587 \\(\u7e41\u9ad4\\) - Traditional Chinese | TBD (Open role) | TBD (Open role) |\n\n## Administrative tasks\n\nTranslation server admins must grant all new translators specific Weblate permissions before translators can start contributing to official supported languages. Translation server admins can reach the server's administration tools by going to https://translate.mattermost.com/admin/.\n\n**Note:** Admin tools on the translation server are being updated to make roles and permissions maintenance easier. If you require translation permissions, please let us know in the [Mattermost localization channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/localization).\n\nTo add a new WIP language:\n\n1. Go to [https://translate.mattermost.com/projects/mattermost](https://translate.mattermost.com/projects/mattermost).\n2. Select a component on the resulting page, then select **Tools > Start new translation**. \n3. Select the languages you want to add, then **Start new translation**.\n\n\n## Translators permissions scheme \nThe goal of the permissions scheme is to be as open as possible to new contributors while keeping the product as safe as possible.\nTherefore, everyone who joins our translation server is able to make translations for the WIP languages, and add suggestions to the shipped languages.\nOur shipped language translators can translate their language, add make suggestions to other shipped languages, and add translations to WIP languages.\n\nThe following Weblate roles control access:\n\n- Mattermost@DefaultUserTranslateWIP: Everyone who joins the Weblate translation server is automatically added to this group, and can translate WIP languages.\n- Mattermost@DefaultUserSuggestionsToShipped: Everyone who joins the server is automatically added to this group, and can make suggestions to the shipped languages.\n- mattermost@Translators [language]: A group for each shipped language. Add translators for each language here. \n\n## Setting up new translations on Weblate\n\n### Step 0 - Permissions\n\nRegister an account and request admin permissions to the [Weblate server](https://translate.mattermost.com/) from Carrie Warner or Tom De Moor.\n\n### Step 1 - Create a new Project (optional)\n\nThis step makes sense when the project has its own repository (e.g. Calls) or if it's helpful to have a separate translation entry point. Another option is to simply skip this step, and add a new component to an existing project.\n\n**Note:** Make sure to enable reviews for the project. In Weblate, go to **Project Settings**, select the **Workflow** tab, and select **Enable Reviews**:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1832946/227036224-cb42bbd5-f101-4d42-b18d-fe5d8f3f44c4.png)\n\n### Step 2 - Add component(s)\n\nAdd a new component under the project.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1832946/227037904-2165a769-0d6d-4b4e-8b6e-2260c2061d60.png)\n\nBase configuration should look as follows:\n\n- *Version control system* should be set to *Github pull request*.\n- *Source code repository* should be set to the GitHub repository where the translation files are stored.\n- *Repository branch* should be set to the primary branch where translations should get merged into (usually either `master` or `main`).\n\nWhen you select **Continue**, Weblate will attempt to scan the repository to find any existing translation files paths. You can now select the one you'd like to cover with this component.\n\nUncheck *Edit base file* as it will prevent contributors from modifying the default language file and prevent potential conflicts.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1832946/227040250-2dec9c1e-da44-41b4-ae12-2ebe3f85681d.png)\n\nSet *Translation flags* to `ignore-inconsistent, ignore-same, icu-message-format`.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1832946/227045392-ca3640bd-d0c1-48d2-86ee-657b40e068b2.png)\n\n### Step 3 - Give translators access to your project\n\nAccess for the shipped languages is restricted to approved users. You must give access to your project on a per-language basis.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6507750/232693426-d0ff9143-1e4a-4181-aaeb-eedd7fb62983.png)\n\n### Step 4 - Repository hooks\n\nRepository hooks (usually GitHub hooks) are needed to keep the translation files on Weblate in sync with the ones commited to the project repository. \n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1832946/227048773-db198f4b-4f73-4e20-a89c-a1b8492bf0df.png)\n\nYou can create a ticket for the Release team to request enabling the hooks.\n\n## How to promote a WIP-language to shipped\n\nYou have to add the new language to the Mattermost platform and to Mobile\nFor Playbooks and Calls no actions are needed\n\n### Step 1 - Adding the language to the Mattermost-platform\n- Add the language code to `server/public/shared/i18n/i18n.go` \n- Add the language to `webapp/channels/src/i18n/i18n.jsx`\n- In the `webapp` directory, run `npm run test:updatesnapshot`\n- Add the modified `webapp/channels/src/components/admin_console/__snapshots__/schema_admin_settings.test.jsx.snap` to your commit.\n- Don't add string translations to the PR.\n\nHere is [an example PR](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/pull/24074) you can use as a starting point.\n\n### Step 2 - Adding the language to Mobile\n- Add the language to `app/i18n/index.ts`\n- Add the language to `app/i18n/languages.ts`\n\nHere is [an example PR](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/pull/7462) you can use as a starting point.\n\n### Step 3 - Adding the language to the Desktop-platform\n- Import the translation file into `i18n/i18n.ts`, and add the language to the menu.\n\nHere is [an example PR](https://github.com/mattermost/desktop/pull/2872) you can use as a starting point.\n\n\n",

This workspace is updated weekly; however, translations can lag behind Cloud releases by up to two weeks.</p>\n<h3>Missed translations</h3>\n<p>If you encounter a product string that hasn't yet been translated in the Mattermost Cloud workspace, the string is either not yet translated, or the workspace hasn't been updated yet to include that translated string. </p>\n<p>You can search for strings in the English localization resource file within a respective GitHub repository to confirm whether a missed translation or an outdated workspace. The following resource files are available for US English strings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/blob/master/i18n/en.json\">mattermost-server and mattermost-webapp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/assets/base/i18n/en.json\">mattermost-mobile</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/desktop/blob/master/i18n/en.json\">mattermost-desktop</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each Mattermost GitHub repository above will contain additional resource files for each supported language. If a string appears in the <code>en.json</code> file, but displays in English in a localized resource file, that string likely isn't translated yet. An English string in the <code>en.json</code> file that is translated in its associated localized resource file likely indicates that the workspace hasn't been updated yet to include that translation.</p>\n<p>If you discover a missing translation, please let us know in the <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/localization\">Mattermost localization channel</a>. </p>\n<h2>Translation maintenance</h2>\n<p>Product translations require updates on a monthly basis as features are added and changed. Weekly updates and deadlines are announced in the <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/localization\">Mattermost localization channel</a>.</p>\n<p>Below are current official reviewers and maintainers for officially supported languages.

        "content": "# Things Candidates Should Know\n\n**Mattermost's mission is to accelerate the world's mission critical work by developing and delivering secure, open core collaboration software providing unrivaled focus, adaptability, and resilience to our customers.**\n\n### Bring your best self to work at Mattermost\n\nWe care about enabling our communities, and for staff this means that we strive to foster a high trust and results-focused culture - results matter far more than hours spent in an office. While our headquarters is in Palo Alto, California, we use Mattermost software to work as a distributed organization around the world in partnership with our community.\n\nIf you're considering a role at Mattermost, here are the **Top 10 Reasons to work at Mattermost:**\n\n1. **Join an outstanding team:** Work with thoughtful, talented, high performance people who care about results.\n2. **Build on the cutting edge:** Develop in Golang, React, React Native, and other technologies that are changing the world.\n3. **100% remote:** No commute, complete control of your environment.\n4. **Be recognized:** Working in open source, your contributions are public and echo on throughout your career.\n5. **Growth:** Join a growing open source project, a growing business, and a growing company.\n6. **Do good:** Build open source software benefiting thousands of companies, institutions, schools, and non-profits.\n7. **Improve a product you use every day:** Work on a team with deep empathy for users and customers.\n8. **Focus on results:** Output matters, not hours worked. Enjoy life and don\u2019t burn out.\n9. **Learn, Master, Teach:** Building new skills, becoming experts, and training others is core to our culture.\n10. **Friends around the world:** Build relationships with staff and contributors in dozens of countries/regions.\n\nIn addition to this page, we also encourage anyone interested in interviewing at Mattermost to read [About Mattermost](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost).\n\n## Working and meeting across the globe\n\n### Remote first\n\nWe\u2019re headquartered in Palo Alto, California and, like many open source companies, Mattermost's staff and contributors are widely geographically located. We run as a distributed, high performance, and high trust team using a few principles:\n\n#### 1. Work remotely with good internet\n\nWorking remotely offers flexibility, more time with loved ones, no commute, and controlling everything about your workspace.\n\nThe one requirement is having the ability to [join video calls using Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362023-System-Requirements-for-PC-Mac-and-Linux) between 8am and 1pm California time, which requires a reliable internet connection. Recommended download/upload speeds should be 8 Mbps/512 kbps for smooth group calling and screensharing, with a bare minimum of 4 Mbps/128 kbps. The [Ookla Speed Test](https://www.speedtest.net/) can be used to check your internet speed.\n\nThere are exceptions to this requirement, for example: Part-time roles that don\u2019t need to take meetings, or roles providing support outside core meeting hours. Hiring Managers and Recruiters will indicate any time zone requirements for specific roles and/or teams.\n\n#### 2. Be clear and precise\n\nWorking in a distributed organization means it may take time before a person reads your message and responds, so make sure you are clear.\n\nCommunicate relevant information in the first message:\n\n* Avoid \u201cAre you free to talk?\u201d and \u201cCan we talk about something at 3pm?\u201d, instead use \u201cCan we speak about ulimit issue Customer X is having?\u201d\n\nWrite unambiguously:\n\n* Avoid \u201cI think the answer is Yes\u201d, instead use \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d, or \u201cI think the answer is Yes, I\u2019ll confirm with Steve and let you know.\u201d\n\nLikewise, we emphasize written communication. Reading is faster than listening and it reaches more people, which means more happens in less time.\n\n#### 3. Take ownership\n\nOwn the outcomes of your work: When working on problems, requests, and feedback always be clear about next steps, and either drive the resolution or create a ticket to track the work. Communicate blindspots and help your teammates understand potential [Brown M&Ms](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#brown-m-and-ms).\n\n#### 4. Make meaningful connections\n\nWe have [ice-breakers](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/ice-breakers) in some meetings to learn more about each other. It\u2019s part of our culture where we get to know each other. Find time after meetings and video conferences to get to know your teammates. Ask them about their weekends and how their life is outside of work.\n\nWhen you meet in person at off-sites and events, build on those relationships.\n\n#### 5. Be the change you want to see\n\nWhen something isn't clearly documented, take the initiative to figure out what's going on, and update the documentation for the people who come after you.\n\n[Learn, Master, Teach](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#learn-master-teach) is a model we use to pass on training after you\u2019ve been trained to help grow everyone at the company.\n\n### Where we Hire\n\nMattermost has registered entities in the US, Canada, Germany and the UK and we hire from these locations. For hiring in locations outside of these entities, we use an Employer of Record (EOR) service, which allows us to comply with local employment laws and regulations.\n\n### Meetups\n\nWe have Meetups around the world to deepen and broaden our relationships and build the future of our products together.\n\n* Watch highlights of our Community Meetups in Toronto, Canada: [Archery Tag in 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c9oJdbXrMU), [Curling in 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K7DDhe1wHI) and [CN Tower in 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c9oJdbXrMU&t=4s).\n* [MatterCon](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/mattercon#goal) is an annual conference for Mattermosters and the contributor community to come together.\n  * [MatterCon 2020 in Nassau, Bahamas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA3DK0u2L4).\n  * [MatterCon 2019 in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMySvCfy7Bw&feature=youtu.be).\n  * [MatterCon 2018 in Lisbon, Portugal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZXaYttz3NA&feature=youtu.be).\n* Teams will also plan meetups, with locations determined by the Team Lead.\n\n**Additional resources**\n\n* [Mattermost Blog](https://mattermost.com/blog/)\n* [Mattermost Leadership Principles](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles)\n\n### Interview process\n\nWe can hire from many countries and regions across the globe. While in-office interviews typically go through 1-3 interview rounds, our candidates and interviewers may be located in various time zones and therefore each interview is scheduled separately.\n\n## Interview stages\n\nAs a fully remote and global team, Mattermost interviewers are located in different time zones. Since we also interview candidates across different time zones, we schedule interviews one-on-one as opposed to a panel of interviews on one specific date. Below are the typical stages and number of interviewers a candidate can expect in a full interview process at Mattermost.\n\nAll interviews take place over video \\(using Zoom\\). Interviewers will wait 5 minutes for a candidate to join before leaving the interview. We encourage candidates to email their recruiting contact and the Mattermost interviewer if they are not able to make a scheduled interview.\n\n1. **Recruiter Screen:** This is a candidate's main point of contact during the interview process at Mattermost. For some roles, Hiring Managers may incorporate a recruiter screen within their first interview with a candidate.\n2. **Hiring Manager, Technical, and Team Interviews:** This portion typically consists of 3-4 interviewers. In addition to the Hiring Manager, candidates can expect to interview with team and cross-team members who will work closely with, or similarly to, the individual in this role.\n3. **Interview Project:** All take-home projects will list the expected amount of time expected to complete. We really appreciate all of the time spent completing a take-home project. As a 'thank you,' candidates will be invited to select a gift option upon completion of the project.\n4. **Final Interviews:** This typically includes the Hiring Team's [MLT](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms#mlt) and one of our co-founders per the [\"As Appropriate\" interview process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/recruiting#as-appropriate-interviews-aa-s). Corey Hulen is final approver on any R&D candidates, including Engineers, Product Managers, and UX. Ian Tien is final approver on all other FTE hires. **Note:** For Director and above interviews, and interviews outside of engineering for technical or product roles, both Mattermost co-founders will interview candidates.\n5. **Final Decision:** A member of the Hiring Team will reach out to you to let you know our decision.\n\nWe hope that you have a great experience interviewing at Mattermost and welcome any feedback you may have. We may invite candidates to share feedback about our interview process so we may continually improve the process and experience.\n\n## Reference checks and offer stage\n\nCandidates will receive a verbal offer to join Mattermost. Upon verbal acceptance, the hiring team will send the contract paperwork to the new candidate. Offer letters will be signed internally first:\n\n* [CAO to initial](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-processes/company-agreements#who-are-contract-accountability-owners-caos) as the first signer.\n* The prospective staff member will be the third and final signer.\n\nReference checks are typically done through [SkillSurvey](https://www.skillsurvey.com/reference-checking-solution/) or a Hiring Manager may decide to conduct references on their own. Candidates will be informed of reference type ahead of providing references. All contracts are contingent on the successful and satisfactory completion of reference checks.\n\n### General benefits\n\n#### Flexible hours\n\nResults matter far more than hours in an office. Your time at Mattermost is flexible. Go see the dentist, visit a friend, walk your dog \u2013 no need to ask permission.\n\nIf there\u2019s something urgent going on at work, just let [teammates know your status](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/paid-time-off#where-to-go-to-see-whos-out).\n\nFor most roles, we require the ability to join meetings between 8am and 1pm California time. The exception is people who are dedicated to support in other time zones, or team members that don\u2019t need to be in real-time discussions.\n\n#### Paid time off and holidays\n\nLearn more about our [paid time off and holidays policy and process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/paid-time-off).\n\n#### Home office benefits\n\nStaff have full control of their own space. We offer a [guideline on home office purchases](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#home-office-guidelines).\n\nWe understand that working from home every day may not be practical for every individual. We will reimburse staff for [flexible office space](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#other-expenses).\n\n#### Mobile and home internet\n\nWe reimburse $50 per month of [home internet costs](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#other-expenses) as well as a portion of [monthly mobile device subscriptions](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#mobile-device-policy) where appropriate.\n\n#### Professional development\n\nWe want to enable staff to do the best work of their careers at Mattermost. In addition to [360-style performance reviews](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/performance-reviews-50) and transparent career and role leveling, Mattermost team members can also receive a reimbursement up to $500 USD for [professional development](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#other-expenses) annually.\n\n**Additional employee benefits**\n\nMattermost offers additional benefits to employees based in the [US](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1th9epdlK7LfSuJcT11MBaO33zCZS6FbPKGRAbiwczZ4/edit) and [Canada](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k9JkMxSI5qQjG_9V_QdWYynFn1XTxKynajpVRycvLPQ/edit).\n\n#### Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Are there core hours that I'll be expected to work?**\n\nWe have a weekly all-company [Customer Obsession Meeting](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-cadence#customer-obsession-meeting-aka-com). We understand staff may not be able to attend every week. The meeting is 25 minutes and a recording is shared internally for staff that may not be able to attend. There may be team-specific schedule requirements depending on the team and role, such as teams with SLAs or on-call requirements. Your Recruiter or Hiring Manager will indicate any specific team core hours during the interview process.\n\n\n### Relocating\n\nStaff agreements are conditioned upon the country/region of residence noted in a staff member's contract. Location change requests should be discussed with HR and your MLT member. Staff must receive written approval from the company prior to a country/region relocation.\n\n",

Hiring Managers and Recruiters will indicate any time zone requirements for specific roles and/or teams.</p>\n<h4>2. Be clear and precise</h4>\n<p>Working in a distributed organization means it may take time before a person reads your message and responds, so make sure you are clear.</p>\n<p>Communicate relevant information in the first message:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid \u201cAre you free to talk?\u201d and \u201cCan we talk about something at 3pm?\u201d, instead use \u201cCan we speak about ulimit issue Customer X is having?\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Write unambiguously:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid \u201cI think the answer is Yes\u201d, instead use \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d, or \u201cI think the answer is Yes, I\u2019ll confirm with Steve and let you know.\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Likewise, we emphasize written communication. Reading is faster than listening and it reaches more people, which means more happens in less time.</p>\n<h4>3. Take ownership</h4>\n<p>Own the outcomes of your work: When working on problems, requests, and feedback always be clear about next steps, and either drive the resolution or create a ticket to track the work. Communicate blindspots and help your teammates understand potential <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#brown-m-and-ms\">Brown M&amp;Ms</a>.</p>\n<h4>4. Make meaningful connections</h4>\n<p>We have <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/ice-breakers\">ice-breakers</a> in some meetings to learn more about each other. It\u2019s part of our culture where we get to know each other. Find time after meetings and video conferences to get to know your teammates. Ask them about their weekends and how their life is outside of work.</p>\n<p>When you meet in person at off-sites and events, build on those relationships.</p>\n<h4>5. Be the change you want to see</h4>\n<p>When something isn't clearly documented, take the initiative to figure out what's going on, and update the documentation for the people who come after you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#learn-master-teach\">Learn, Master, Teach</a> is a model we use to pass on training after you\u2019ve been trained to help grow everyone at the company.</p>\n<h3>Where we Hire</h3>\n<p>Mattermost has registered entities in the US, Canada, Germany and the UK and we hire from these locations. For hiring in locations outside of these entities, we use an Employer of Record (EOR) service, which allows us to comply with local employment laws and regulations.</p>\n<h3>Meetups</h3>\n<p>We have Meetups around the world to deepen and broaden our relationships and build the future of our products together.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watch highlights of our Community Meetups in Toronto, Canada: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c9oJdbXrMU\">Archery Tag in 2019</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K7DDhe1wHI\">Curling in 2018</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c9oJdbXrMU&amp;t=4s\">CN Tower in 2017</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/mattercon#goal\">MatterCon</a> is an annual conference for Mattermosters and the contributor community to come together.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA3DK0u2L4\">MatterCon 2020 in Nassau, Bahamas</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMySvCfy7Bw&amp;feature=youtu.be\">MatterCon 2019 in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZXaYttz3NA&amp;feature=youtu.be\">MatterCon 2018 in Lisbon, Portugal</a>.</li>\n<li>Teams will also plan meetups, with locations determined by the Team Lead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Additional resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mattermost.com/blog/\">Mattermost Blog</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles\">Mattermost Leadership Principles</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Interview process</h3>\n<p>We can hire from many countries and regions across the globe. While in-office interviews typically go through 1-3 interview rounds, our candidates and interviewers may be located in various time zones and therefore each interview is scheduled separately.</p>\n<h2>Interview stages</h2>\n<p>As a fully remote and global team, Mattermost interviewers are located in different time zones. Since we also interview candidates across different time zones, we schedule interviews one-on-one as opposed to a panel of interviews on one specific date. Below are the typical stages and number of interviewers a candidate can expect in a full interview process at Mattermost.</p>\n<p>All interviews take place over video (using Zoom). Interviewers will wait 5 minutes for a candidate to join before leaving the interview. We encourage candidates to email their recruiting contact and the Mattermost interviewer if they are not able to make a scheduled interview.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Recruiter Screen:</strong> This is a candidate's main point of contact during the interview process at Mattermost. For some roles, Hiring Managers may incorporate a recruiter screen within their first interview with a candidate.</li>\n<li><strong>Hiring Manager, Technical, and Team Interviews:</strong> This portion typically consists of 3-4 interviewers. In addition to the Hiring Manager, candidates can expect to interview with team and cross-team members who will work closely with, or similarly to, the individual in this role.</li>\n<li><strong>Interview Project:</strong> All take-home projects will list the expected amount of time expected to complete. We really appreciate all of the time spent completing a take-home project. As a 'thank you,' candidates will be invited to select a gift option upon completion of the project.</li>\n<li><strong>Final Interviews:</strong> This typically includes the Hiring Team's <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms#mlt\">MLT</a> and one of our co-founders per the <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/recruiting#as-appropriate-interviews-aa-s\">\"As Appropriate\" interview process</a>. Corey Hulen is final approver on any R&amp;D candidates, including Engineers, Product Managers, and UX. Ian Tien is final approver on all other FTE hires. <strong>Note:</strong> For Director and above interviews, and interviews outside of engineering for technical or product roles, both Mattermost co-founders will interview candidates.</li>\n<li><strong>Final Decision:</strong> A member of the Hiring Team will reach out to you to let you know our decision.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We hope that you have a great experience interviewing at Mattermost and welcome any feedback you may have. We may invite candidates to share feedback about our interview process so we may continually improve the process and experience.</p>\n<h2>Reference checks and offer stage</h2>\n<p>Candidates will receive a verbal offer to join Mattermost. Upon verbal acceptance, the hiring team will send the contract paperwork to the new candidate. Offer letters will be signed internally first:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-processes/company-agreements#who-are-contract-accountability-owners-caos\">CAO to initial</a> as the first signer.</li>\n<li>The prospective staff member will be the third and final signer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reference checks are typically done through <a href=\"https://www.skillsurvey.com/reference-checking-solution/\">SkillSurvey</a> or a Hiring Manager may decide to conduct references on their own. Candidates will be informed of reference type ahead of providing references. All contracts are contingent on the successful and satisfactory completion of reference checks.</p>\n<h3>General benefits</h3>\n<h4>Flexible hours</h4>\n<p>Results matter far more than hours in an office. Your time at Mattermost is flexible. Go see the dentist, visit a friend, walk your dog \u2013 no need to ask permission.</p>\n<p>If there\u2019s something urgent going on at work, just let <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/paid-time-off#where-to-go-to-see-whos-out\">teammates know your status</a>.</p>\n<p>For most roles, we require the ability to join meetings between 8am and 1pm California time. The exception is people who are dedicated to support in other time zones, or team members that don\u2019t need to be in real-time discussions.</p>\n<h4>Paid time off and holidays</h4>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/paid-time-off\">paid time off and holidays policy and process</a>.</p>\n<h4>Home office benefits</h4>\n<p>Staff have full control of their own space. We offer a <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#home-office-guidelines\">guideline on home office purchases</a>.</p>\n<p>We understand that working from home every day may not be practical for every individual. We will reimburse staff for <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#other-expenses\">flexible office space</a>.</p>\n<h4>Mobile and home internet</h4>\n<p>We reimburse $50 per month of <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#other-expenses\">home internet costs</a> as well as a portion of <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#mobile-device-policy\">monthly mobile device subscriptions</a> where appropriate.</p>\n<h4>Professional development</h4>\n<p>We want to enable staff to do the best work of their careers at Mattermost. In addition to <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/performance-reviews-50\">360-style performance reviews</a> and transparent career and role leveling, Mattermost team members can also receive a reimbursement up to $500 USD for <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money#other-expenses\">professional development</a> annually.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional employee benefits</strong></p>\n<p>Mattermost offers additional benefits to employees based in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1th9epdlK7LfSuJcT11MBaO33zCZS6FbPKGRAbiwczZ4/edit\">US</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k9JkMxSI5qQjG_9V_QdWYynFn1XTxKynajpVRycvLPQ/edit\">Canada</a>.</p>\n<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>\n<p><strong>Are there core hours that I'll be expected to work?</strong></p>\n<p>We have a weekly all-company <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-cadence#customer-obsession-meeting-aka-com\">Customer Obsession Meeting</a>. We understand staff may not be able to attend every week. The meeting is 25 minutes and a recording is shared internally for staff that may not be able to attend. There may be team-specific schedule requirements depending on the team and role, such as teams with SLAs or on-call requirements. Your Recruiter or Hiring Manager will indicate any specific team core hours during the interview process.</p>\n<h3>Relocating</h3>\n<p>Staff agreements are conditioned upon the country/region of residence noted in a staff member's contract. Location change requests should be discussed with HR and your MLT member. Staff must receive written approval from the company prior to a country/region relocation.</p>",

The goal of the program is to recognize exceptional community contributions that go above and beyond.\n\n[GitHub Sponsors](https://docs.github.com/en/github/supporting-the-open-source-community-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-github-sponsors) allows the developer community to financially support the people and organizations who design, build, and maintain the open source projects they depend on, directly on GitHub.\n\n## Who is eligible?\n\nMattermost GitHub sponsorship is considered for [MVP](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/mvp/)-like contributors \\(\"Most Valued Professional\"\\) in any of the [available regions](https://github.com/sponsors) supported by GitHub.\n\nMVP-like contributors:\n\n- Focus on contributions that have a wider impact that many can benefit from.\n- Have proven success working asynchronously in a self-serve, autonomous way that doesn\u2019t  require many direct touch points with Mattermost teams to develop, test, or document their contribution.\n- Give extra effort in a way that exceeds what\u2019s expected.\n- Has, shares, and delivers on a clear vision.\n- Steps forward to assist when opportunities present themselves.\n- Has demonstrated empathy and understanding for the software development process.\n\n## Eligible contribution areas\n\n- Technical peer help on demand via public forums, including but not limited to: Mattermost Community server, Mattermost User Forum, and the Mattermost subreddit on Reddit.\n- Product localization via string translation (known also as l10n and i18n).\n- Lead monthly product localization delivery (cherry-pick L10N PRs, weekly community communication, data analytics/reporting, develop and deliver nurture campaigns to increase translation quality).\n- Product evangelism for technical communities.\n- Fix product issues and add new product functionality to improve the user experience.\n- Address user journey gaps such as migration tooling.\n- Customer-requested product integrations.\n\n## What types of contributions aren't eligible?\n\n- Code changes to features that Mattermost charges money to use. This includes features available only to Professional or Enterprise customers that aren't open-sourced, and code within the ``/enterprise`` GitHub repository where the majority of paid Enterprise features are maintained.\n- Mattermost product and development documentation contributions. Documentation isn\u2019t currently eligible because of the range of effort complexity involved (from typo fixes to new content development) which doesn\u2019t directly map to the [existing reimbursement structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P88K3p-wDbV9nLZNkBnMk_SJvt90gzlRq3Pj0ZPBOZg/edit#).\n\n## Process outline\n\n1. A Mattermost staff member recommends a contributor for sponsorship and writes a short motivation to support their recommendation. The nomination should include a description of what the contributor does for us and/or takes ownership for that we'd like to compensate them for. The nomination should be addressed to their direct manager as well as the program lead.\n2. An [MLT](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms#mlt) senior leader approves the recommendation and notifies the program lead.\n3. Program lead sends a request to ap@mattermost.com to approve the sponsorship.\n4. Program lead informs the contributor of the nomination. Once the contributor has accepted it \\(by simply replying to the notice\\), the sponsorship is processed and appears in the contributor's GitHub profile.\n5. The staff member who recommended the contributor acts as an internal mentor to provide product guidance.\n\n## Quarterly check-ins\n\nAll sponsorship participants are expected to participate in quarterly check-ins with the program lead. Check-ins can occur asychronously on the Mattermost Community Server, or scheduled as a live meeting using Zoom. The goal of quarterly check-ins is to ensure organizational and program alignment, contributor satisfaction, support, empowerment, as well as participant retention. Continued sponsorship will be reviewed quarterly, and align with the end of Mattermost fiscal year quarters: April, July, October, and January. Sponsorship will be paused following 3 consecutive months of inactivity, disengagement, or failing to respond to check-in requests.\n\nDuring quarterly check-ins:\n- Participants meet with the program lead to share their program feedback on what\u2019s going well, what\u2019s not going well, and any blockers encountered.  \n- Internal team members working closely with participants share contextual performance feedback with the program lead.\n\n## Process for contributors to exit the program\n\n1. The sponsored contributor informs the program lead, by email, of their intention to leave the program.\n2. The program lead sends a request to IT to remove any applicable core contributor privileges as well as the sponsorship itself. Accounts Payable and the staff member who nominated the contributor are included for visibility.\n\n## Notes\n\n* The current program lead is Carrie Warner.\n\n",

This page is intended to give candidates an overview of our interview process.\n\n## Typical interview process\n\nIf your application indicates a strong alignment with the role you've applied for, our Recruitment team will contact you to initiate the interview process as outlined below.\n\n### Candidate questionnaire\n\nCandidates are sent a questionnaire with a set of standard and role-specific questions as part of the candidate application. Candidates that Mattermost's Recruiting or Hiring Manager have contacted directly are asked to complete these questions as part of the first interview schedule. The answers are kept in the candidate's Lever profile.\n\n### [Recruiter Screen](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#recruiter-screen-optional)\n\nThe Recruiter for each role conducts a screening interview. The screen includes standard Mattermost questions and specific questions to assess the candidate's experience, skillset, and mindset. The Recruiter also shares an overview of the [Mattermost Leadership Principles](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding/staff-onboarding-guide#leadership-principles). Candidates are encouraged to ask any questions about the role, team, and Mattermost. We want you to learn about us as much as we learn about you.\n\n### Interview panel\n\nThe Hiring Manager's interview is part of the first interview panel. This panel also includes 3 - 4 team members that are either members of the direct team the potential candidate would be joining or cross-team members that this role will work closely with. Each interviewer has specific focus areas for their portion of the interview to assess one area of the candidate's experience and skillset.\n\n### Interview project\n\nMost roles at Mattermost include a take-home project as part of the interview process. Projects are typically assigned after the second or third intervew (including Recruiter Screen).\n\n**Getting started with the project**\n\nAll projects indicate the expected amount of time required to complete the project. This is intended to help provide each candidate with clarity on timing expectations. When you decide on the project you'd like to complete, your Recruiter and Hiring Manager will give you any additional information related to the project. Your Recruiter may ask you to sign an agreement ahead of the interview project, which will be one of the following:\n\n* The [Contributor Licence Agreement](https://mattermost.com/mattermost-contributor-agreement/) (\"CLA\") will be required to sign if your take-home project forms part of our [Mattermost Community](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us#open-source-contributors).\n* The [NDA agreement](https://na3.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=75563bac-a0ac-4aef-a434-06d9c33c1f90&env=na3&acct=e5bb8810-00ab-47c2-af80-9d331c19377f&v=2) may be required if your take-home project doesn't require the CLA to be signed. Your Recruiter will confirm this step.\n\n**Gift card options**\n\nMattermost recognizes and appreciates that candidates spend personal time to complete this project. To share our appreciation, candidates recieve a \"Thank You\" gift card upon completion of the interview project. Candidates can choose from a variety of gift cards, including: Apple iTunes, Google Plan, eBay, Visa Gift Card. If you are located in a region where you aren't able to use these gift card options, please let your Recruiter know. We're happy to work with you to identify a gift card that you can use.\n\n### References stage\n\nIn between the interview project and the final round of interviews, we run references using the SkillSurvey platform. Candidates should provide 3 - 4 references, with at least one being a direct Manager.\n\n### Final interviews\n\nFinal interviews include meeting with the team's [MLT](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/mlt-cadence#introduction-to-mlt) member and one of [Mattermost's Co-Founders](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/mlt-cadence#introduction-to-mlt).\n",

        "title": "Staff Recruiting",
        "content": "# Staff Recruiting\n\n## Staff Recruiting\n\nIn order to continually increase what we offer to customers we need to continually source, assess, hire, and onboard new staff members with [high standards](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding/staff-onboarding-guide#leadership-principles). The below outlines the process for recruiting new staff into the company in relation to opening a new role, the interview flow, and the offer process.\n\n### How to open a new role\n\nHiring Managers should confirm with their team's [MLT](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/mlt-cadence#introduction-to-mlt) that the new headcount requisition has been approved.\n\nHiring plans are created twice a year, and reviewed every quarter. Hiring Managers and department leads can request additional headcount by completing a [New Requisition ID Request Form](https://forms.gle/ewYXCm1FZPAb6Pyr6). As part of this request form and only for non-backfill roles, Hiring Managers will be asked to submit an [Issue/Solution Proposal](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-processes/issue-solution). Finance assigns all requisition IDs and the CEO \\(Ian Tien\\) and CFO \\(Kendra Niedziejko\\) will need to approve ISP ahead of a new requisition ID assignment.\n\n### Role description\n\nOnce you have confirmation that your new headcount has been approved, you\u2019re ready to begin the recruitment process. Complete the [Job Description portion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DmInqCLfGpFOP6Foynu9MB3Xl71CfcgFWxuuSEAP50U/edit) and share with your Recruiter, who will schedule a [Recruiter Intake Session](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting/recruiting-cadences.html) to review the remainder of the intake template.\n\n### Recruiter Intake Session\n\nYour Recruiter will schedule an Intake Session with you and a People Partner after you\u2019ve completed your Job Description. The goal of the in-take is to have a complete Ideal Candidate Profile, Target Level for the role and assigned interviewers, and interview backups (if neeeded).\n\n#### Role leveling\n\nYou can view the current [v1 Job Levels here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kNsl7JUWDQ8MhWonys9dR3osrxEWYkKVIoECfFKSQzw/edit#gid=0). Levels will be finalized during the Recruiter Intake Session.\n\n**Note:** HR is also working with MLT to build v2 which will help provide additional clarity. If you're unsure about how to use or assign a level to a new job requisition, your Recruiter can help you walk through this as part of the Recruiter Intake Session.\n\n#### Ideal Candidate Profile \\(ICP\\)\n\nThe ICP should be a clear list of key skills, experiences, and/or mindsets that the Hiring Manager believes represent the Ideal Candidate. The Hiring Manager will be asked to stack-rank the ICP list and use \"P0\" to indicate \"must-haves\" and \"P1\" to indicate \"nice-to-have\" the ideal skills, experiences, and mindsets.\n\nThe ICP will be used to align the sourcing, interview panel focus areas, and onboarding goals for this new role. For example, here\u2019s an ICP for a [Digital Marketing Manager](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nJju3ILPZBV4hm77Z7LELK_c0bClOMEdvbxXnZDhNX4/edit#slide=id.g1120f15fe91_0_184). The ICP should reflect the top skills, experience, and mindsets that are most important for successful candidates based on what a new hire's eventual onboarding goals, AORs, and projects will be.\n\n#### Changing the ICP\n\nThe ICP is also a helpful indicator of talent pools. If a role is not gaining enough candidate pipeline or the candidate fit is off, the ICP enables Hiring Managers to efficiently determine appropriate tradeoffs as it relates to the \"P0\" or \"P1\" skills, experience, and mindsets.\n\nFor example, a Recruiter may find that we have filtered multiple candidates who do not have a specific \"P0\" skill. As a result, a Hiring Manager may determine that it may be worth deprioritizing a specific qualification from \"P0\" to \"P1\" in order to widen the candidate pool. If an ICP is ever changed, the Recruiter will ensure that the hiring team is aligned to the change.\n\n### Pre-Interview Screening\n\nHiring Managers will review the Pre-Interview Screening process during the Recruiter Intake Session.\n\n#### Resume screen\n\nHiring Managers will review resumes and tag their Recruiter in Lever to indicate interest in a candidate. Hiring Managers can review candidates that are in the **Shortlist** or **New Lead** stage.\n\nThe Recruiter will also archive candidates that are located in countries/regions we are not able to hire or do not match the location target of the role.\n\n#### Post-application candidate questions \\(optional\\)\n\nThis is an optional step, but is highly recommended to improve candidate and job match ahead of any reach out. Hiring Managers can create a set of questions that every candidate will be asked to complete either as part of the application process or before the Recruiter Intake Screen.\n\n#### Recruiter Screen \\(optional\\)\n\nHiring Managers can customize the questions asked during the Recruiter Screen or they may decide to remove this stage and handle the first screen themselves. The purpose of this screen is to:\n\n* Have one main point of contact throughout the interview process.\n* Collect compensation requirements and verify country/region of residence.\n* Provide the candidate with more information on: Mattermost, the role, the recruiting process, and to understand the candidate\u2019s: timeline, role/career aspirations, assess interest, compensation expectations, and answer questions.\n* Hiring Managers can also request the Recruiter to ask specific questions as part of the Recruiter Screen. Hiring Managers can decide the set of questions during the Recruiter Intake Session.\n\n### Pre-meet scores \\(optional\\)\n\nDuring the selection process and prior to meeting candidates, Hiring Managers face two big challenges:\n\n* **High volume:** Too many applications and resumes potentially qualified for the job description.\n* **Not enough clarity:** It's easy to miss amazing talent that doesn't have a well-written resume \\(a lot of top talent doesn't need to look for jobs, they just get referred by people who worked with them before\\).\n\nBecause of this, we offer Hiring Managers a framework for summarizing a potential candidate's background ahead of meeting them \\(i.e. a \"pre-meet score\"\\), which can be completed by recruiters, by candidate screeners, or by the candidate themselves.\n\nThere are multiple pre-meet scores:\n\n* **Company pre-meet score:** A score to help identify candidates that may have advantages in succeeding in our culture or in advantages to the company in increasing our ability to connect with underrepresented talent pools \\(international experience, different gender identities, educational backgrounds, etc.\\)\n* **Department pre-meet score:** Each department may have its own criteria used in recruiting screens to provide an additional pre-meet score in addition to the company pre-meet score.\n\n#### Company pre-meet score\n\nCompany pre-meet scores are as follows:\n\n**Community experience**\n\n* **Open source businesses \\(+1\\):** Worked in company on the [Commercial Open Source Company Index](https://medium.com/open-consensus/1-the-100b-commercial-oss-company-index-cossci-f808ae3a16ab) or some experience in open source in general.\n* **Open source contributor \\(+2\\):** Has a GitHub or GitLab account and contributed to open source projects.\n* **Mattermost contributor \\(+10\\):** Has made a contribution to the Mattermost open source project or open source code integrating with our software.\n* **Customer, partner or user \\(+3\\):** Works for a customer, partner or company that uses Mattermost software.\n\n**Industry experience**\n\n* **DevOps workflow experience \\(+3\\):** Practitioner of DevOps or worked in vendor of DevOps tools.\n* **Hyper-growth business** **\\(+1\\):** Worked in a company growing 2x to 3.5x year-over-year for at least two years.\n* **Unified communications experience \\(+1\\):** Worked at a company sponsoring [Enterprise Connect](https://www.enterpriseconnect.com/) conference or worked on product associated with the space \\(Slack, Microsoft Teams, Facebook Workspaces, WebEx Teams, Cisco Jabber, Chime, Facebook Workplace, Yammer, Jive, SharePoint, Lync, Skype for Business, etc.\\).\n* **Mobile security \\(+1\\):** Worked with Enterprise Mobility Management \\(EMM\\) solutions or at companies like AirWatch, Mobile Iron, Good Technologies/Blackberry Dynamics, etc.\n* **On-prem or hybrid software \\(+1\\):** Helped customers be successful on infrastructure that they alone control.\n* **Enterprise software experience \\(+1\\):** Worked in business with 50%+ revenue coming from customers with over 10,000 employees.\n* **Social or mobile messaging or games experience \\(+3\\):** Experience in social networking, social games, mobile games, or mobile messaging with understanding of online collaboration in consumer/prosumer space. Our consumer/prosumer DNA from [being a video game company before we were an enterprise software company](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/open-source-devs-racing-build-better-versions-slack/) is a competitive advantage for us vs. other enterprise software companies.\n\n**Workstyle**\n\n* **Former YC founder \\(+1\\)**\n* **Success working from home, at least 2 years \\(+2\\)**\n* **Success working in Slack, HipChat, Discord or similar IRC-based messenger \\(+2\\)**\n* **Used Mattermost at work \\(+3\\)**\n* **Technical undergraduate degree \\(+1\\)**\n\n**Perspective**\n\n* **Does not currently reside in San Francisco Bay Area \\(+3\\)**\n* **Worked outside the U.S. for at least 2 years as an adult \\(+2\\)**\n* **Gender identity other than male \\(+3\\)**\n* **Lack of any university or college education \\(+3\\):** For someone to be highly successful in technology without a formal education is rare and team members with this profile can help us expand into new talent pools.\n\n### Interview process\n\nInterview panels and the order of interviewers is determined by the Hiring Manager during the Recruiter Intake Session. Ahead of the first interview for a new requisition, the Recruiter will send the Interview Team a summary of the Interview Plan, including each interviewer's focus area\\(s\\). Hiring Manager will also indicate the Interview Mid-Point which will also drive the Mid-Interview Syncs.\n\nFor the purpose of a positive candidate experience and efficient use of mana, it's recommended that there be no more than four non-Hiring Manager and non-MLT interviewers. Ultimately, the Hiring Manager will decide how many interviewers are needed.\n\n#### Interview Panel process\n\nAs part of the Recruiter Intake Session, the Recruiter also works with the Hiring Manager to define the scope and focus area\\(s\\) for each interviewer using the ICP. Ahead of the first candidate interview, the Recruiter posts an update in the Recruiting Updates Channel and tags the Interview Panel.\n\nThe update includes the scope and focus area\\(s\\) for each interviewer. To promote [high standards](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding/staff-onboarding-guide#leadership-principles) hiring, if more than two interviewers are not a **Strong Yes** ahead of the Mid-Interview Sync, the candidate will not move forward.\n\n**Interview Panel SLAs**\n\nIn order to expedite the recruiting process for each candidate, please follow the feedback timeline:\n\n1. Interviewers should submit their 1-4 rating in Lever within 1 hour of the interview completion.\n2. Interviews should submit their full summary feedback within 24 hours of the interview.\n\n**Tips on sharing candidate feedback**\n\n* Required: Lever\u2019s 1 - 4 rating on the candidate. See rating definitions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ZyJpPUvmmitccOAewFLrh9etwLObBoLCNj3i0Fvlis/edit#heading=h.105ke47pauhj).\n* Required: Experience-to-team rating.

This should be objective and simple. For example: \"Strong Yes for SRE, but not quite as technical in Kubernetes as John Doe.\"\n* Feedback on the specific skill/focus area assigned, with examples to help contextualize your rating.\n* Potential [blindspots](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#shoulder-check) or [brown M&Ms](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#brown-m-and-ms) that may require either a future interviewer to ask about or the Hiring Manager to cover during a reference check.\n\n#### Panel Debrief\n\nAhead of making an offer, a Debrief will be scheduled to ensure the hiring team is aligned by achieving a unanimous \"I'm 100% hire on this candidate for level and role.\" [Link to Debrief Template] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1euXMz6kCU3baOsBURKFxqWmfANNbBpkL7Z8H7llUp1Q/edit) to review the process, purpose and intended outcomes. \n\n#### As Appropriate interviews \\(AAs\\)\n\nTo ensure the quality bar and culture of Mattermost is strong and rising, an \"As Appropriate\" interview is required with a senior, tenured Mattermost staff member for any candidate before an offer can be extended.\n\nTypically the AA is the last person on the interview loop and scheduled in advance and cancelled if the candidate doesn't get through the loop - i.e. an AA interview should not slow down the interview process.\n\nThe following list of people are approved as As Appropriate interviewers:\n\n* Ian Tien, CEO and co-founder for all roles outside of R&D\n* Dave Reardon, VP of Worldwide Sales for all BDR roles.\n\nEach AA interviewer should have at least three reserved slots per week available for AA interviews, ideally in different timezone ranges, providing capacity for 12 new hires per month per AA.\n\n### Checklist for As Appropriate interview\n\nAt least 24 hours before an AA interview, the candidate's Lever profile should include:\n\n1. Completed feedback from all interviewers.\n2. Attachments of any work artifacts produced during the interview loop (e.g. presentations, coding projects, etc.).\n3. Compensation expectations and role Level in a SECRET note in Lever.\n4. For interviews with Ian Tien, a [CEO pre-interview questionaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGFUN7baIFot6me_oDWTSICA_QhRFM9dBRiqBTw38uRY6XDQ/viewform) from the candidate should also be included. The AA scheduler will send the questionaire to be completed.\n\nIf the Lever information is not complete, the AA interview request will not be scheduled.\n\n**Logistics**\n\n* The Debrief will be pre-scheduled to occur after the AA interview.\n* If there are multiple candidates for the same role, the sync may be scheduled after all candidates have gone through the last mid-interviewer.\n* If you are an interviewer and cannot make the scheduled sync, please make sure to submit complete feedback in Lever ahead of the scheduled sync.\n\n#### Interview project\n\nCandidates may be asked to complete a take-home project as part of the interview process. Hiring Managers will indicate this need during the Recruiting Intake Session. Hiring Managers can create their own project or reach out to Recruiting for sample projects.\n\nAll take-home projects should list the expected amount of time to complete. This provides candidates with expectation clarity. The Hiring Manager will indicate which stage of the recruiting process a take-home will be given. The process for this stage will be standard for all roles:\n\n1. Hiring Manager or Recruiter will inform the candidate of the take-home project details and ask the candidate to complete either:\n   * [CLA](https://mattermost.com/mattermost-contributor-agreement/) if the take-home project is a Community ticket.\n   * NDA if the above doesn\u2019t apply.\n2. Hiring Manager or Recruiter will send the candidate the take-home project instructions through Lever.\n3. Upon completion, the Hiring Manager or Recruiter will complete the [Interview Project Gift Card Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMppjsYmEyrMmY3tXnKdAs_cvA21o0vHRcyuVN6uFOoU3_Eg/viewform) which will notify the People Team to send a Thank You gift to the candidate for completing the project.\n\n### Offer stage\n\n#### Reference checks\n\nReference checks are required and Hiring Managers should determine their preferred method for reference checks. See the [Recruiting Playbook - Reference Checks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ziIFoI0dB0_WZZHBeGAy0BLNMafl0jGAdQ6Z7QA3Ah8/edit#heading=h.2utbizbsdr5h) for additional instructions.\n\n#### Offer approval process\n\nOnce reference checks are complete and an offer is ready to be made, the Recruiter enters the offer information in Lever for approval.\n\nThe order of approval will follow:\n\n1. VP, HR\n2. Team MLT member\n3. CFO\n4. CEO \n\nAfter offer approval, the Recruiter, Team MLT member, or AA Interviewer will extend a verbal offer to the candidate. Upon verbal acceptance, HR will send the offer letter.\n\n#### Extending an offer\n\nRecruiting will typically extend an offer, unless otherwise determined by the MLT member or Hiring Manager. Exceptions may be made if the Team MLT member or AA interviewer prefers to extend the offer.\n\n#### Sending an offer and notifying internal teams\n\nThis process will be managed by HR.\n\n1. Once an offer is approved, the People Generalist will select the appropriate offer template based on candidates\u2019s residence country/region and send for signatures.\n2. Upon full execution of a new staff contract, the Recruiter will mark the candidate as **Hired** in Lever.\n3. Once exported to Rippling, an automatic New Starter Notification will be sent to the Hiring Team to kick-off the onboarding process.\n\n#### Pre-onboarding preparation\n\nNew colleagues will receive pre-onboarding instructions from the People team. Hiring Managers will also need to complete [pre-onboarding activities](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/onboarding/manager-onboarding-1#onboarding).\n",
        "html": "<h1>Staff Recruiting</h1>\n<h2>Staff Recruiting</h2>\n<p>In order to continually increase what we offer to customers we need to continually source, assess, hire, and onboard new staff members with <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding/staff-onboarding-guide#leadership-principles\">high standards</a>. The below outlines the process for recruiting new staff into the company in relation to opening a new role, the interview flow, and the offer process.</p>\n<h3>How to open a new role</h3>\n<p>Hiring Managers should confirm with their team's <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/mlt-cadence#introduction-to-mlt\">MLT</a> that the new headcount requisition has been approved.</p>\n<p>Hiring plans are created twice a year, and reviewed every quarter. Hiring Managers and department leads can request additional headcount by completing a <a href=\"https://forms.gle/ewYXCm1FZPAb6Pyr6\">New Requisition ID Request Form</a>. As part of this request form and only for non-backfill roles, Hiring Managers will be asked to submit an <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-processes/issue-solution\">Issue/Solution Proposal</a>. Finance assigns all requisition IDs and the CEO (Ian Tien) and CFO (Kendra Niedziejko) will need to approve ISP ahead of a new requisition ID assignment.</p>\n<h3>Role description</h3>\n<p>Once you have confirmation that your new headcount has been approved, you\u2019re ready to begin the recruitment process. Complete the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DmInqCLfGpFOP6Foynu9MB3Xl71CfcgFWxuuSEAP50U/edit\">Job Description portion</a> and share with your Recruiter, who will schedule a <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting/recruiting-cadences.html\">Recruiter Intake Session</a> to review the remainder of the intake template.</p>\n<h3>Recruiter Intake Session</h3>\n<p>Your Recruiter will schedule an Intake Session with you and a People Partner after you\u2019ve completed your Job Description. The goal of the in-take is to have a complete Ideal Candidate Profile, Target Level for the role and assigned interviewers, and interview backups (if neeeded).</p>\n<h4>Role leveling</h4>\n<p>You can view the current <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kNsl7JUWDQ8MhWonys9dR3osrxEWYkKVIoECfFKSQzw/edit#gid=0\">v1 Job Levels here</a>. Levels will be finalized during the Recruiter Intake Session.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> HR is also working with MLT to build v2 which will help provide additional clarity. If you're unsure about how to use or assign a level to a new job requisition, your Recruiter can help you walk through this as part of the Recruiter Intake Session.</p>\n<h4>Ideal Candidate Profile (ICP)</h4>\n<p>The ICP should be a clear list of key skills, experiences, and/or mindsets that the Hiring Manager believes represent the Ideal Candidate. The Hiring Manager will be asked to stack-rank the ICP list and use \"P0\" to indicate \"must-haves\" and \"P1\" to indicate \"nice-to-have\" the ideal skills, experiences, and mindsets.</p>\n<p>The ICP will be used to align the sourcing, interview panel focus areas, and onboarding goals for this new role. For example, here\u2019s an ICP for a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nJju3ILPZBV4hm77Z7LELK_c0bClOMEdvbxXnZDhNX4/edit#slide=id.g1120f15fe91_0_184\">Digital Marketing Manager</a>. The ICP should reflect the top skills, experience, and mindsets that are most important for successful candidates based on what a new hire's eventual onboarding goals, AORs, and projects will be.</p>\n<h4>Changing the ICP</h4>\n<p>The ICP is also a helpful indicator of talent pools. If a role is not gaining enough candidate pipeline or the candidate fit is off, the ICP enables Hiring Managers to efficiently determine appropriate tradeoffs as it relates to the \"P0\" or \"P1\" skills, experience, and mindsets.</p>\n<p>For example, a Recruiter may find that we have filtered multiple candidates who do not have a specific \"P0\" skill. As a result, a Hiring Manager may determine that it may be worth deprioritizing a specific qualification from \"P0\" to \"P1\" in order to widen the candidate pool. If an ICP is ever changed, the Recruiter will ensure that the hiring team is aligned to the change.</p>\n<h3>Pre-Interview Screening</h3>\n<p>Hiring Managers will review the Pre-Interview Screening process during the Recruiter Intake Session.</p>\n<h4>Resume screen</h4>\n<p>Hiring Managers will review resumes and tag their Recruiter in Lever to indicate interest in a candidate. Hiring Managers can review candidates that are in the <strong>Shortlist</strong> or <strong>New Lead</strong> stage.</p>\n<p>The Recruiter will also archive candidates that are located in countries/regions we are not able to hire or do not match the location target of the role.</p>\n<h4>Post-application candidate questions (optional)</h4>\n<p>This is an optional step, but is highly recommended to improve candidate and job match ahead of any reach out. Hiring Managers can create a set of questions that every candidate will be asked to complete either as part of the application process or before the Recruiter Intake Screen.</p>\n<h4>Recruiter Screen (optional)</h4>\n<p>Hiring Managers can customize the questions asked during the Recruiter Screen or they may decide to remove this stage and handle the first screen themselves. The purpose of this screen is to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have one main point of contact throughout the interview process.</li>\n<li>Collect compensation requirements and verify country/region of residence.</li>\n<li>Provide the candidate with more information on: Mattermost, the role, the recruiting process, and to understand the candidate\u2019s: timeline, role/career aspirations, assess interest, compensation expectations, and answer questions.</li>\n<li>Hiring Managers can also request the Recruiter to ask specific questions as part of the Recruiter Screen. Hiring Managers can decide the set of questions during the Recruiter Intake Session.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Pre-meet scores (optional)</h3>\n<p>During the selection process and prior to meeting candidates, Hiring Managers face two big challenges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High volume:</strong> Too many applications and resumes potentially qualified for the job description.</li>\n<li><strong>Not enough clarity:</strong> It's easy to miss amazing talent that doesn't have a well-written resume (a lot of top talent doesn't need to look for jobs, they just get referred by people who worked with them before).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because of this, we offer Hiring Managers a framework for summarizing a potential candidate's background ahead of meeting them (i.e. a \"pre-meet score\"), which can be completed by recruiters, by candidate screeners, or by the candidate themselves.</p>\n<p>There are multiple pre-meet scores:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Company pre-meet score:</strong> A score to help identify candidates that may have advantages in succeeding in our culture or in advantages to the company in increasing our ability to connect with underrepresented talent pools (international experience, different gender identities, educational backgrounds, etc.)</li>\n<li><strong>Department pre-meet score:</strong> Each department may have its own criteria used in recruiting screens to provide an additional pre-meet score in addition to the company pre-meet score.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Company pre-meet score</h4>\n<p>Company pre-meet scores are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Community experience</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open source businesses (+1):</strong> Worked in company on the <a href=\"https://medium.com/open-consensus/1-the-100b-commercial-oss-company-index-cossci-f808ae3a16ab\">Commercial Open Source Company Index</a> or some experience in open source in general.</li>\n<li><strong>Open source contributor (+2):</strong> Has a GitHub or GitLab account and contributed to open source projects.</li>\n<li><strong>Mattermost contributor (+10):</strong> Has made a contribution to the Mattermost open source project or open source code integrating with our software.</li>\n<li><strong>Customer, partner or user (+3):</strong> Works for a customer, partner or company that uses Mattermost software.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Industry experience</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>DevOps workflow experience (+3):</strong> Practitioner of DevOps or worked in vendor of DevOps tools.</li>\n<li><strong>Hyper-growth business</strong> <strong>(+1):</strong> Worked in a company growing 2x to 3.5x year-over-year for at least two years.</li>\n<li><strong>Unified communications experience (+1):</strong> Worked at a company sponsoring <a href=\"https://www.enterpriseconnect.com/\">Enterprise Connect</a> conference or worked on product associated with the space (Slack, Microsoft Teams, Facebook Workspaces, WebEx Teams, Cisco Jabber, Chime, Facebook Workplace, Yammer, Jive, SharePoint, Lync, Skype for Business, etc.).</li>\n<li><strong>Mobile security (+1):</strong> Worked with Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) solutions or at companies like AirWatch, Mobile Iron, Good Technologies/Blackberry Dynamics, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>On-prem or hybrid software (+1):</strong> Helped customers be successful on infrastructure that they alone control.</li>\n<li><strong>Enterprise software experience (+1):</strong> Worked in business with 50%+ revenue coming from customers with over 10,000 employees.</li>\n<li><strong>Social or mobile messaging or games experience (+3):</strong> Experience in social networking, social games, mobile games, or mobile messaging with understanding of online collaboration in consumer/prosumer space. Our consumer/prosumer DNA from <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/03/open-source-devs-racing-build-better-versions-slack/\">being a video game company before we were an enterprise software company</a> is a competitive advantage for us vs. other enterprise software companies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Workstyle</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Former YC founder (+1)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Success working from home, at least 2 years (+2)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Success working in Slack, HipChat, Discord or similar IRC-based messenger (+2)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Used Mattermost at work (+3)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Technical undergraduate degree (+1)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Perspective</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Does not currently reside in San Francisco Bay Area (+3)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Worked outside the U.S. for at least 2 years as an adult (+2)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Gender identity other than male (+3)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Lack of any university or college education (+3):</strong> For someone to be highly successful in technology without a formal education is rare and team members with this profile can help us expand into new talent pools.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Interview process</h3>\n<p>Interview panels and the order of interviewers is determined by the Hiring Manager during the Recruiter Intake Session. Ahead of the first interview for a new requisition, the Recruiter will send the Interview Team a summary of the Interview Plan, including each interviewer's focus area(s). Hiring Manager will also indicate the Interview Mid-Point which will also drive the Mid-Interview Syncs.</p>\n<p>For the purpose of a positive candidate experience and efficient use of mana, it's recommended that there be no more than four non-Hiring Manager and non-MLT interviewers. Ultimately, the Hiring Manager will decide how many interviewers are needed.</p>\n<h4>Interview Panel process</h4>\n<p>As part of the Recruiter Intake Session, the Recruiter also works with the Hiring Manager to define the scope and focus area(s) for each interviewer using the ICP. Ahead of the first candidate interview, the Recruiter posts an update in the Recruiting Updates Channel and tags the Interview Panel.</p>\n<p>The update includes the scope and focus area(s) for each interviewer. To promote <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding/staff-onboarding-guide#leadership-principles\">high standards</a> hiring, if more than two interviewers are not a <strong>Strong Yes</strong> ahead of the Mid-Interview Sync, the candidate will not move forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Interview Panel SLAs</strong></p>\n<p>In order to expedite the recruiting process for each candidate, please follow the feedback timeline:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Interviewers should submit their 1-4 rating in Lever within 1 hour of the interview completion.</li>\n<li>Interviews should submit their full summary feedback within 24 hours of the interview.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Tips on sharing candidate feedback</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Required: Lever\u2019s 1 - 4 rating on the candidate.

Please keep in mind that applicants can be declined from the position at any stage of the process.\n\nBoth declined and accepted candidates will be invited to share feedback on their hiring experience so we can continually improve our process.\n\n* **Application/Email - Review of resume** - Recruiter and at least one member of the Product Management team reviews your resume and assesses your experience, skills and application questions.\n* **Video call - Screening interview** - Selected candidates will be invited for a 25-minute screening call with a recruiter.\n* **Video call - PM-skills discussion** - Next, candidates will be invited to schedule a 50-minute interview with a Product Manager to assess product management skills and for the candidate to learn more about the role.\n* **Video call - Soft-skills discussion** - Next, candidates will be invited to schedule a 50-minute interview with a Lead Developer to assess soft skills and for the candidate to learn more about the role.\n* **Video call - PM-skills and thought process discussion** - Next, candidates will be invited to schedule a 50-minute interview with Head of Product to assess product management skills, thought process and for the candidate to learn more about the role.\n* **Audition** - Candidates who appear technically strong and culturally fit may be offered a real-world \"try out\" project with Mattermost team members to simulate the types of problems they will be working on.\n* **Video call - Audition review** - Candidates are invited to a 50-minute interview with a senior member of our team to review the audition.\n* **Video call - CTO interview** - Finally, candidates will have a 45-minute interview with our CTO.\n* **Email - Offer** - Successful candidates will receive an offer via email.

        "content": "# Mattermost Community\n\nAt Mattermost, we be believe workplace messaging will become a leading platform for workflow and business process. We believe building such a platform on open source infrastructure has powerful advantages.\n\nWe consider people who share these beliefs, and who seek to benefit from or influence the Mattermost open source project, to be part of the \u201cMattermost Community\u201d.\n\nThe success of Mattermost as an open source platform for messaging-based workflow and business process depends on empowering our community to build with us towards a shared vision.\n\nThe Mattermost community has two parts, Users and Contributors, detailed below.\n\n{% hint style=\"info\" %}\nInterested in contributing to Mattermost? [Learn about all the ways to get involved with our community](https://mattermost.com/contribute/).\n{% endhint %}\n\n## Users\n\nIn general, all members of the Mattermost community are users of the open source project. They can range from end users and system administrators, to developers on the Mattermost platform in some way. The common bond we all share is that we benefit from the project\u2019s continued and growing success.\n\nThe user community has a number of segments:\n\n### End users\n\nPeople using Mattermost to communicate and achieve their organization\u2019s top priorities.\n\n### IT administrators\n\nPeople deploying Mattermost and supporting end users.\n\n### System integrators\n\nPeople who extend and customize Mattermost privately but who do not share back their work with the open source community \\(for a range of reasons, often related to confidentiality\\) are considered \u201cusers\u201d. When users are able to share their work with others in the community they are recognized as \u201ccontributors\u201d.\n\n#### Customers\n\nOrganizations that purchase Mattermost Enterprise Edition as an extension of the Mattermost open source project for advanced features are known as \"customers\". While the Mattermost roadmap is focused on benefiting the broad community, large customers may accelerate certain parts of the roadmap they find most valuable through purchasing large numbers of Enterprise Edition licenses.\n\n### Contributors\n\nContributors are a subset of the Mattermost community who help increase the overall benefits of Mattermost for others. This may be as simple as offering feature ideas, reporting bugs, or offering professional installation and deployment services. Or it can be as complex as building whole new products based on Mattermost, or contributing code to the underlying software.\n\nThe work of all contributors is valued, appreciated, and recognized as a driving force behind the project\u2019s growth.\n\nThere are many ways to contribute.\n\n### Solution contributors\n\nAs of May 2020, [over 1,900 open source projects on GitHub reference Mattermost](https://github.com/search?q=mattermost). Solution Contributors create a host of technologies to empower Mattermost software to solve real world problems. Technologies include:\n\n* **Self-hosted integration solutions:** Includes connectivity and integration with third-party applications such as Jira, Confluence, GitLab, Jenkins, and other tools.\n* **SaaS-based integration solutions:** Includes connectivity and integration with services like Twitter, Zendesk, Salesforce, and hundreds of other extensions with services like Zapier.\n* **Programming solutions:** Includes language-specific drivers and connectors to simplify the work of other developers.\n* **Mattermost user experience plugins:** Includes server and client-side plug-ins that enhance the native capabilities of a Mattermost server, such as voice, video, and screensharing with Zoom\u2019s self-hosted or vendor-hosted solutions.\n* **Federated experiences:** Includes bridges with IRC, Slack, and other messaging applications through solutions like Matterbridge.\n* **Custom user experiences:** Includes integrations into Terminal and Pidgin built off the same core APIs as Mattermost\u2019s Web, Desktop, iOS, and Android experiences.\n\nCommunity Coordinator: Jason Blais\n\n**LinkedIn recognition**\n\nYou are welcome to document your contributions to the Mattermost open source project in your resume or on LinkedIn in any matter you feel is accurate. Below is an example of an entry:\n\n* Title: `Open Source Solution Contributor`\n* Organization/Company: `Mattermost`\n* Location: `[Where you did your work]`\n* From: `[Date started]`\n* I currently work here: `Check \"Yes\" if you continue to maintain your work`\n* Headline: `Solution contributor for Mattermost open source project`\n* Description: `[Description of your solution, its benefit to end users, and link to project. Example: \"Maintainer of Mattermost-Zoom plugin which offers voice, video and screensharing for Mattermost end users through Zoom integration, either through a self-hosted private cloud deployment or a vendor-hosted SaaS service from Zoom. See the project at https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-zoom.\"]`\n\nOther contributor types beyond solution contributors are also welcome to use and modify this LinkedIn template to document their contributions.\n\n### Platform contributors\n\nPlatform contributors provide improvements to the core Mattermost open source projects under [https://github.com/mattermost/](https://github.com/mattermost/). Contributions may be made at different levels of skill and impact:\n\n* **Level 1:** Stated intention to contribute by completing [Mattermost Contributor Agreement](https://mattermost.com/mattermost-contributor-agreement/) which adds contributor\u2019s name to [Mattermost Approved Contributor\u2019s list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1NTCeG-iL_VS9bFqtmHSfwETo5f-8MQ7oMDE5IUYJi_Y/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true).\n* **Level 2:** Corrections or improvements to on-screen text, documentation, or help text. Cosmetic improvements to code base.\n* **Level 3:** Corrections of minor bugs in code base other than on-screen text, documentation, or help text either through spontaneous contribution or by volunteering for and being assigned a ticket by a core committer.\n* **Level 4:** Corrections to major bugs, or the implementation of minor feature either through spontaneous contribution or by volunteering for and being assigned a ticket by a core committer. Alternatively, requesting and being assigned a ticket of 2 mana or higher by core committer and completing the project.\n* **Level 5:** Requesting and being assigned a ticket of 8 mana or higher by core committer and completing the project.\n* **Core Committer:** Highly skilled developer who becomes a maintainer and regular contributor to core Mattermost open source projects.\n\nAll contributors Level 2 and above are eligible for a [custom-printed Mattermost Mug](https://forum.mattermost.org/t/limited-edition-mattermost-mugs/143) acknowledging their role in the open source project.\n\nCommunity Coordinator: Jason Blais and Ben Schumacher\n\n### Translation contributors\n\nTranslation contributors can create and update translations to existing or new Mattermost languages at [https://translate.mattermost.com](https://translate.mattermost.com/). In addition, community members can become \u201cLanguage owners\u201d and help review, coordinate and supervise the translation of Mattermost into languages they speak.\n\nCommunity Coordinator: Jason Blais\n\n### Documentation contributors\n\nDocumentation Contributors update, edit, and create new documentation, help text, training, and other materials to help the community get the most out of Mattermost software. Core documentation is found at [https://docs.mattermost.com](https://docs.mattermost.com/) and contributions can be made via the open source repository at [https://github.com/mattermost/docs/](https://github.com/mattermost/docs/).\n\nCommunity Coordinator: Carrie Warner and Justine Geffen\n\n### Quality Assurance contributors\n\nQuality Assurance contributors help find, confirm and report product defects via our process at [https://www.mattermost.org/filing-issues/](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/contributors/ways-to-contribute). Anyone who encounters a verifiable defect is welcome to file a bug on the system.\n\nBonus: When a QA contributor finds and reports a bug on a release candidate build of Mattermost prior to the final release of the system, they can be awarded a [Mattermost Bug Hunter Award](https://forum.mattermost.com/t/mattermost-bug-hunter-awards/4979) for their contribution.\n\nCommunity Coordinator: TBD\n\n### Knowledge Base contributors\n\nKnowledge Base contributors share feedback, questions, and answers on Mattermost through forums for [troubleshooting](https://docs.mattermost.com/install/troubleshooting.html), [feature proposals](https://mattermost.com/feature-ideas/), GitHub issues, and on the [Mattermost community server](https://community.mattermost.com/).\n\nCommunity Coordinator: Amy Blais\n\n### Deployment solution contributors\n\nDeployment solutions contributors create packaging and automation for making it easier to deploy Mattermost, using tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, and other leading virtualization and orchestration solutions. See [Deployment Solutions Programs](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/orchestration.html) for guidance on how to build to common Mattermost standards.\n\nCommunity Coordinator: Jason Blais and Amy Blais\n\n### UX Design contributors\n\nUX Design contributors influence the design of the Mattermost user experience through discussion in the `ux-design` channel on the Mattermost continous integration server at [https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/ux-design](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/ux-design) and through contributions to the [Mattermost User Experience Guidelines](https://zeroheight.com/29be2c109/p/36db8f-why-compass) on [GitHub](https://github.com/mattermost/docs/blob/master/source/developer/fx-guidelines.rst).\n\nCommunity Coordinator: Andrew Brown\n\n### Coordination contributors\n\nCoordination Contributors help organize and align contributors from all the different roles above. When coordinating and leading a contributor community, key principles to keep in mind include:\n\n* Make it easy and realistic for contributors to get started.\n\nHave clear instructions and realistic expectations. Remember there are thousands of open source projects in the world so the more difficult it is to contribute the fewer contributions there will be.\n\n* Recognize, retain, and recruit\n\nRecognizing people\u2019s contributions is vital to keeping them engaged. Leverage the existing programs to acknowledge the impact people are having. Retaining active contributors is hugely impactful because they\u2019re trained and ready to go on future projects, and both acknowledgement for jobs done well and new, interesting projects are key to keeping momentum going. The next more important is recruiting new contributors and being able to showcase a vibrant and active existing community to offer a model for new contributions.\n\n* Focus on high impact, skill appropriate contributions\n\nWhen possible, influence contributors to apply themselves to the highest impact tickets and projects appropriate for their skill level. Meaningful contributions early in the contributor journey are a powerful way to draw people into the community.\n\n### Mattermost staff\n\nMattermost staff are paid by Mattermost, Inc. to take on any of the contributor roles mentioned above, as well as to develop and support Mattermost Enterprise Edition as a commercial extension of the Mattermost open source project for large and sophisticated organizations.\n",

You can take a look at the specific rules of interaction in every Mattermost project, as governed by our [Code of Conduct](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/mattercon/mattermost-code-of-conduct), activities by contributors and other community members.\n\n## Respect one's time\n\nWith the scale of Mattermost and its communities, we can't assume everyone is working at the same pace as ourselves. We also can't be aware of all the constraints on an individual's time. Whether there are personal or professional responsibilities, many people have significant draws on their time. If someone you need input from is unreachable, reach out in a kind way. If the issue isn't a blocker, give the other person ample time to respond.\n\n## Respect one's timezone\n\nWith contributors and staff around the world, there is no way to know when any person involved in Mattermost is available. Some folks will work their local 9-5 but others choose hours convenient to them and their team. Be conscious of when people are available and what works for them. Again, if it isn't a blocker, patience helps. If it's a blocker, perhaps reach out and see if someone else can help.\n\n## Use kind words\n\nOften when we're in a professional setting we think the goal is to be to-the-point. But, occasionally, brevity can be confused for being terse. Using kind words, along with thankful responses when others assist us, helps make the process not just more cordial, but also welcoming. This is especially important when considering new members to our community.\n\n## Respecting differences\n\nBeing a global community means people from all walks of life are involved in making Mattermost amazing. While we may not all see things from the same point of view, it's important to always take a moment to take another person's perspective into account. When interacting with others be open-minded and courteous toward their thoughts and statements. Be patient and if things remain unclear, perhaps a polite request to explain the meaning of things may help.\n\nWe want Mattermost to be safe, secure, and welcoming to all people anywhere in the world. Kindness goes a long way to building what we want our community to be.\n",

        "title": "How to Run a Hackathon",
        "content": "# How to Run a Hackathon\n\nThis page outlines best practices and recommended steps for running a Hackathon.\n\nPreviously, Hackathons have run twice a year with one coinciding with MatterCon. In future, Hackathons may be run three or four times a year.\n\nT-minus counts measure \"working days\" \\(weekdays other than major holidays concurrent in US and Canada\\) prior to the Hackathon day. All times are based on 8:00am \\([Palo Alto Time](http://everytimezone.com/)\\) unless otherwise stated.\n\n## A. \\(T-minus 40 working days\\)\n\n1. Decide dates for the Hackathon. Some things to take into consideration:\n   * Avoid overlap with major holidays in US, Canada, Europe, or Asia \\(including Australia and Japan\\).\n   * Avoid overlap with significant release dates, such as release testing or feature complete. Recommended time is starting a Hackathon within a week after feature complete.\n   * Avoid overlap with significant company dates that take significant amount of developers' time, such as performance evaluations.\n   * Avoid overlap with significant community dates, such as major developer conferences/events.\n   * Avoid starting on a Friday - this results in a kick-off call in the late evening for Europe/Asia, effectively meaning the Hackathon starts on a weekend in those areas.\n   * Previous Hackathons ran for two days with presentations on the third date. At the end of the most recent Hackathon participating developers suggested adding a third day to allow more time for polish and increased quality.\n2. Identify at least one or two developers to partner with during the Hackathon. Start by reaching out to either VP Engineering or Dev Leads to hear their recommendations.\n\n## B. \\(T-minus 30 working days\\)\n\n1. Put together a project plan, including task description, start date, due date, owner, and any additional notes. [See an example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15iiLPzJjlajHQVgQa9HulW9WfBauIlnkCOJ07oKz7_U).\n2. Identify one or two members in Marketing to partner with, who can help with tweets, blog posts, and other marketing content to generate awareness of the Hackathon.\n3. Identify one or two members in Ops to partner with, who can help with meeting scheduling, SWAG, and other operational tasks.\n\n## C. \\(T-minus 25 working days\\)\n\n1. Work with Ops to decide on what SWAG to send for participation - both for contributors and staff.\n2. Create a landing page for the Hackathon, which contains all information and to which other communication items are linked.\n   * This can be a webpage such as [one for Feb/2019 Hackfest](https://mattermost.com/hackfest2019/) or a GitHub repository such as [one for Nov/2019 Hackathon](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-hackathon-nov2019).\n   * All processes and documentation should be clearly included on this landing page, including a process for finding and assigning teams and project submission guidelines. FAQs can be incorporated as needed.\n3. Create a GitHub repository for submitting Hackathon projects. This can be the same as the landing page if a GitHub repository is used for it.\n\n## D. \\(T-minus 20 working days\\)\n\n1. Announce the Hackathon internally by posting in [Private Staff Discussion channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/platform) and sharing in the R&D weekly meeting.\n2. Schedule a kick-off call with all Hackathon stakeholders, including\n\n   the developer, Marketing, and Ops members identified previously.\n\n3. Define and set up metrics to measure impact of the Hackathon. Examples include: Number of participants \\(staff + community separately\\), number of submissions, number of submissions shipped as a core feature or as a plugin in the Marketplace.\n\n## E. \\(T-minus 15 working days\\)\n\n1. Create Meetup links for Hackathon idea presentation, kick-off, and demos. For examples, see [Mattermost Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/mattermost/).\n2. Share the Hackathon externally via Reddit, GitHub, Discourse, and the [community server](https://community.mattermost.com). For examples, see previous [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mattermost/comments/dvvsm4/mattermost_hackathon_nov_22_26/), and [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues/13087).\n3. Publish a blog post announcing the Hackathon to the Mattermost community, which links back to the landing page for details on how to participate.\n\n## F. \\(T-minus 10 working days\\)\n\n1. Schedule a series of tweets announcing and reminding community of the upcoming Hackathon. See [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W5j5dYa3ZjSgEocniWXTEO2xjj5A8S9ihD03snUnLnA/edit#heading=h.s3nujhxhjrxo) for examples.\n2. Work with Ops team to get SWAG prizes ready and set up with Printfection.\n\n## G. \\(T-minus 5 working days\\)\n\n1. Hold a Hackathon idea presentation call, scheduled for 60 minutes, with an additional 30 minutes for extra time. This time is used to gather feedback about ideas and to attract others to work as a team. To see previous slides and meeting recording, see [Hackathon Nov/2019 Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iBVGDzdwZ72oEY6mshzjcgJQ4NdhXRfW).\n\n## H. \\(T-minus 0 working days\\)\n\n1. Hold a Hackathon kick-off call, scheduled for 30 minutes. To see previous slides and meeting recording, see [Hackathon Nov/2019 Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iBVGDzdwZ72oEY6mshzjcgJQ4NdhXRfW).\n\n## I. \\(T-plus 3 working days\\)\n\n1. Hold a Hackathon demo call, scheduled for 2 hours, with an additional hour for extra time. This time is used for participants to present their project. Invite the entire Mattermost organization to the call as optional attendees.\n   * Provide guidelines and best practices for creating presentations \\(both for staff and community\\).\n   * Three minutes allowed per Hackathon participant. For participants with multiple submissions, five minutes total is allowed for the presentations.\n   * Ask participants who can't attend to submit a demo video, which is shared during the call.\n\n## J. \\(T-plus 5 working days\\)\n\n1. Ask developers to hold a Hackathon retrospective and share feedback for future improvements.\n2. Hold a Hackathon post-mortem call among key stakeholders \\(developers, marketing, ops\\).\n3. Work with ops to gather a list of winners and send SWAG prizes via Printfection.\n4. Gather a list of submissions and separate them by R&D feature teams. Product Managers on the respective teams will be responsible for discussing with Dev Leads on which submissions make sense to ship as core features or plugins, and scope out remaining work.\n\n## K. \\(T-plus 7 working days\\)\n\n1. Publish blog post sharing insights of the Hackathon.\n2. Update this process doc for changes in running a Hackathon.\n\n## Tips and Best Practices\n\n1. Do not use your own Zoom link for Hackathon calls. Recommend using a company Zoom link, or one created specifically for Hackathon.\n2. In Zoom, go to **Settings &gt; Recording** and set **Recording consent** to true. This prompts participants to consent to be recorded when recording starts.\n\nNote that the list below contains suggestions or questions that are not yet incorporated into the above process. For developer feedback from November/2019 Hackathon, see [this retrospective](https://community.mattermost.com/core/pl/xuirmrmob38oznx75j8cj3bkme).\n\n1. How will Hackathon presentations be handled in the future at scale? The presentations took two hours in November/2019 with 44 participants \\(3 minutes per presentation\\), and some suggested the presentations took too long.\n2. Clear process and documentation for new members \\(both in staff and community\\).\n3. Clear process for non-developers to participate, e.g. documentation, UX, QA, support. Overall, offer better cross-communication among team leads and ensure those who want to participate are able to.\n4. Promote Hackathon by using examples from previous hackathons, and tweet about them. Highlight projects that made it into the core product or as supported plugins.\n5. Nominate mentors from within staff or contributors who can provide additional guidance, talk through ideas and help get members going during the Hackathon. Mentors would ideally be contacts from different areas, e.g. mobile, plugins, webapp. Publish the list from which new members \\(either core or staff\\) can then sign up to work with.\n6. Provide more opportunities to plan projects, such as setting up meeting invites with interested people.\n7. Make it easier to get community involved in specific projects, and work with staff.\n8. Improve social aspects. For instance, incorporate physical meetups timed with Hackathon, or virtual hangouts in Discord.\n9. Activity feed. Have people talk about their projects \\(e.g. share screenshots or daily updates\\) during the Hackathon. Consider promoting in progress work in social media or other public facing sites to increase awareness of the Hackathon.\n10. Promote physical hackathons at universities and have staff or community help run them and get people involved.\n11. Clearly track next steps both for community and staff. One possibility is a shepherding program to encourage submissions to \"cross the finish line\" as a core feature or certified plugin where appropriate.\n\n",

        "content": "# Mattermost Community Playbook\n\nThis playbook outlines various processes and practices used in the Mattermost community, including running community design meetings and campaigns, managing GitHub and forum issues, and managing Twitter.\n\n## Running a community design meeting\n\n### Objectives\n\n1. Avoid blindspots in design by shaping requirements and use cases with user communities.\n2. Confirm proposed approach for design aligns with solving the problem discussed.\n3. Brainstorm ideas for solving open design questions.\n\n### Preparations\n\n1. Research existing solutions to understand potential use cases brought up by communities.\n2. Draft a proposed design for the problem - this can be a rough outline, more concrete mockups or final design.\n3. Decide two meeting times: one for European and Asian communities, another for North and South American communities.\n   * Avoid regional holidays.\n   * Aim for typical working hours in the countries/regions.\n4. Prepare agenda.\n   * Introductions of Mattermost team members part of the meeting.\n   * Review of use cases.\n   * Review of proposed design approach.\n   * Open discussion and Q&A.\n   * Actions and decisions.\n   * Review of next steps.\n5. Create a public meeting link everyone has permission to access, such as a Zoom link.\n6. Prepare an RSVP form for customers, see [example here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdg5NWkI4JcAmGwL3KgoYdtirXTS4wb1GJRXd_20kX2lTo3mw/viewform).\n\n### Announce\n\n1. Prepare a forum post, see [example here](https://forum.mattermost.com/t/community-design-meeting-folded-reply-threads/6729).\n2. Tweet about it, see [example here](https://twitter.com/mattermost/status/1100235276436365312).\n3. Post in appropriate channels on [https://community.mattermost.com](https://community.mattermost.com).\n4. Post in UserVoice if related to an existing feature proposal, see [example here](https://mattermost.uservoice.com/forums/306457-general/suggestions/19572469-make-threads-collapsible#{toggle_previous_statuses}).\n5. Ask customer success teams to share with interested customers.\n\n### Holding the Meeting\n\n1. Record the meeting. Mention that sharing video is optional.\n2. Follow the agenda.\n3. Thank everyone for joining the call.\n\n### After the Meeting\n\n1. Share a summary in all respective channels, including the meeting recording.\n2. Send a survey asking how valuable the meeting was, feedback on additional use cases, and feedback on improving the meeting in the future. [See example here](https://community.mattermost.com/core/pl/jfcmekbw738o3f3ykbbhofkg8r).\n\n### Tips\n\n1. Do not use your personal Zoom meeting link for the call.\n2. Note in all announcements that sharing video is optional.\n3. Use `Mattermost` in your name to identify staff from community members on the call.\n4. Consider sequencing design review meetings with design priorities.\n5. Encourage less vocal attendees to share feedback via written chat.\n\n## Getting the community involved in a campaign\n\nExamples include React Native Apps, Redux, and APIv4 campaigns.\n\n### Onboarding\n\n1. Create a blog post for the [Developer Blog](https://developers.mattermost.com/blog/) letting developers know about the campaign and ways to contribute.\n2. Create a contribution guide. This can be part of the blog post.\n3. Create Help Wanted tickets that a community member could work on.\n\nFor a high priority Help Wanted ticket, reach out to contributors directly in the GitHub repository for best engagement.\n\n### Retention\n\n1. Identify active contributors and thank them personally for their work.\n2. For Work in Progress tickets or submitted pull requests, follow up with contributor once a week for status updates and questions to make sure contributors aren't blocked and feel comfortable asking questions. If there hasn't been activity in more than two weeks, ask if you can help them in some way.\n3. Recognize everyone\u2019s contributions \\(either intrinsic rewards like having their name listed on a contributor\u2019s page or tangible like swag or gift cards\\).\n4. If applicable, assign roles to top contributors \\(such as team lead, code reviewer, tester\\) to give a sense of ownership to the contributor.\n\n### Off-boarding\n\nWhen a campaign is finished, offer suggestions for other campaigns or projects they might be interested in.\n\n## GitHub Help Wanted Issues in `mattermost` Repository\n\n### Goal\n\nIncrease Mattermost usage through larger and more numerous deployments via a vibrant open source community that contributes features that would not otherwise be offered.\n\n### Principles\n\n* Contributors get a worthwhile benefit from their contributions, from the feature directly and/or from social recognition.\n* Community members should have a low barrier to contribute.\n* Community development workflow should be clear, efficient and effective.\n* Help Wanted issues should avoid updates to the Enterprise repository due to complexity in code changes and unit tests.\n\n### Creating Help Wanted Issues\n\nTo create a Help Wanted issue in the [mattermost repository](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost), follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a ticket in Jira that is well-defined and unambiguous.\n\nThe issue should be written with the mindset that the contributor might have no or limited experience with the Mattermost code base and limited exposure to the Mattermost product.\n\n**Note:** Below are a few reasons why Jira tickets for Help Wanted issues are recommended:\n\n* Jira tickets can be used to prioritize Help Wanted issues internally and are easily searchable by Mattermost staff, community, and customers.\n* Each Jira ticket goes through the [triage meeting](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#triage-meeting) for dev and PM approval.\n* Zapier integration automatically creates GitHub Help Wanted issues from labelled Jira tickets, requiring no additional mana.\n* Resolved Jira tickets are automatically assigned to a QA, who tests them against the `master` branch.\n* After creating the ticket, add \"\\(Proposed APR\\)\" to its title, so the triage team knows to consider it for a `help-wanted` label.\n* If the Jira ticket is accepted as a Help Wanted issue during [triage](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#triage-meeting), a `help-wanted` label is added. This action automatically triggers a zap that creates a new issue in the [mattermost repository](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost).\n  * To accept a ticket as a Help Wanted issue, the description should be unambiguous, and include UI description and help text so the change can be implemented and tested by any contributor.\n  * The Triage team also adds the appropriate difficulty level \\(one of `Introductory`, `Intermediate` and `Advanced`\\) and programming language \\(`Go` and `ReactJS`\\) to the description of the Jira ticket.\n* After triage, the PM on community rotation reviews formatting of the GitHub issue and adds appropriate labels for difficulty level and programming language as defined by the Triage team.\n\n[See an example Help Wanted issue here](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/issues/4755).\n\n### Managing Help Wanted Issues\n\nOnce a Help Wanted issue is added, the PM on community rotation is responsible for:\n\n* Answering questions from community members, which get automatically posted in the [Community Heartbeat channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/community-heartbeat).\n* Following up with a community member if there hasn't been a response for more than two weeks.\n\n### Closing Help Wanted Issues\n\nOnce a pull request for an open GitHub Help Wanted issue is merged, please ensure:\n\n* The corresponding GitHub Help Wanted issue is closed, thanking the contributor.\n* The corresponding Jira ticket is resolved.\n\n### Help Wanted Issue Links\n\nBelow is a list of permanent redirects to Help Wanted issue queries:\n\n1. `mattermost` -

Instead say something akin to \u201cthanks for the idea\u201d.\n* **Choose positivity over negativity**\n  * Avoid excuses like \u201cwe\u2019re busy\u201d, or \u201cour team is small\u201d and turn a missing feature into an invitation to share a feature idea to be upvoted.\n* **Do your best to link documentation as answers**\n  * Allows answers to be easily updated dynamically as documentation is updated.\n  * Any questions that should be answered in docs that aren\u2019t should turn into tickets to create that documentation \\(and post ticket in response\\).\n* **Keep community end-user information secure**\n  * If you come across a post that includes the person's IP address, domain name, or other information you think should not be disclosed publicly, edit the post to remove this information. Then click the **hide revision** button so that your edits won't be visible to others on the forum.\n* **Be thankful**\n  * Communities really respond well to being praised and thanked for their work.\n\n### Sample Responses\n\n#### General Issues\n\n1. If an issue has a PR submitted by community, but no associated Jira ticket, leave it open until the PR is merged.\n2. If an issue has a Jira ticket with a `help-wanted` label, there is a Help Wanted ticket in GitHub. It can be closed with the following note:\n\n> Hi @username Thanks for the report! We have created a [Help Wanted issue here](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/tree/12f2f8f897375eca0e494638114b620ee6b20810/contributors/contributors/link%20to%20GitHub%20issue/README.md) and are looking for community's help. Would you be interested helping with a pull request?\n\n1. If an issue has a Jira ticket without a `help-wanted` label and assigned to the current release fix version for a developer to fix, it can be closed with the following note:\n\n> Hi @username Thanks for the report! We have created a [Jira ticket](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/tree/12f2f8f897375eca0e494638114b620ee6b20810/contributors/contributors/link%20to%20Jira%20ticket/README.md) to track it. If you're interested helping with a pull request, please let us know.\n\n1. If an issue has a Jira ticket without a `help-wanted` label but not assigned to the current release fix version, queue Jira ticket back to triage to ask if a Help Wanted issue could be created for it.\n2. If the reporter doesn\u2019t respond in two weeks, close the issue with the following note:\n\n> Hi @username, we haven't received an update so we'll assume that the problem is fixed or is no longer valid. If you still experience the same problem, try upgrading to the latest version. If the issue persists, reopen this issue with the relevant information and we'd be glad to help you where we can.\n\n#### Feature Requests\n\nRespond to the issue with the following note:\n\n> Thanks, appreciate your feedback @{username}. Would you like to [contribute this in the feature idea forum](https://mattermost.com/suggestions) so it can be discussed, upvoted, and considered for a [Help Wanted ticket](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/contributors/help-wanted)? Please include a link back to this GitHub issue. If you're interested in implementing, please say so and we'll prioritize the review.\n>\n> You get **10** votes in the feature idea forum, and each one influences the future of the project.\n\n#### Licensing\n\nTo ask someone to add a license to a GitHub repo, open an issue with the following note, titled `Add an open source license?`:\n\n> Thanks for sharing this project! We'd love to use it as part of the Mattermost open source project \\([https://mattermost.com/](https://mattermost.com/)\\) in our [React Native mobile app](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile) \\(which uses an [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)\\). Would you consider adding a license, such as an MIT or an Apache 2.0 license? To do so, in GitHub you can hit \"Create new file\" and name a file `LICENSE.txt`.\n>\n> ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/177788/19657017/36238482-99d7-11e6-9fd0-f507970891c7.png)\n>\n> This will prompt GitHub to offer a license template:\n>\n> ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/177788/19657044/5a2d8b66-99d7-11e6-8164-ac7f90b10646.png)\n>\n> If you use a license it would make it easy to promote your open source project with the Mattermost community.\n>\n> Thanks kindly for your consideration.\n\n### Difficult Questions\n\nTo respond to tough questions, use the [SCIPAB method](https://www.mandel.com/top-ten-reasons/tools-methodology/scipab) to help formulate a response and send for community lead to review.\n\n* **Situation:** State what you know about your listeners' circumstances that are relevant to your discussion or presentation, e.g., current state of their business, technology, industry, or plans.\n* **Complication:** Identify the critical issues \\(changes, pressures, demands, etc.\\) that are impacting the Situation and creating problems, challenges, or opportunities.\n* **Implication:** Show the personal or business consequences of failing to act on the problems or opportunities described in the Complication.\n* **Position:** State clearly and confidently your opinion about what needs to be done to solve your listeners' problem.\n* **Action:** Help listeners understand the role you want them to play, or the questions you'd like them to consider, during your presentation or conversation.\n* **Benefit:** Describe how your recommended Position and Action will address listeners' specific needs. State the results clearly and quantifiably.\n\n## Mattermost Twitter\n\nGuidelines for Mattermost [Twitter responses](https://twitter.com/mattermost).\n\n### Principles\n\n1. **Avoid acronyms.** Avoid acronyms when possible. For example, say \"pull request\" instead of \"PR\", since only a subset of tweet readers are active GitHub users.\n2. **Use the active voice.** Avoid \"has\", \"was\", \"have been\" when possible. For example, instead of \"Hackfest has started!\" say \"Hackfest starts now!\"\n3. **Include at most one link.** To provide a clear call to action, include at most one link per tweet and place it near the end of the tweet.\n4. **Use exclamation marks only for exciting announcements.** An exclamation mark can be used when the announcement is exciting, but using an exclamation mark should be avoided when it can be confused with a signal for community to panic, e.g. \"Security update released!\".\n5. **Be welcoming.** When asking someone to take action, use \"Would you be open to\" instead of \"Would you like to\".\n\n### Response Writing Tips\n\n1. When to like \\(heart\\) a tweet where Mattermost is mentioned?\n   * Our team is on site at an event and tags our handle.\n   * A community member shares an event we are at, received a Mattermug, or shared a positive experience and mentions us.\n2. When to retweet a post?\n   * A community member released an integration and mentions us.\n   * Mattermug tweets from community members.\n\n### Sample Responses\n\n#### Requests for more information such as a preview of our product.\n\n> Thank you for your interest in Mattermost. You can learn more about us at https://mattermost.com/ where you can also download a trial of our product.\n\n#### Requests for a specific feature or group of features.\n\n* Multiple Feature Requests:\n\n> Thank you for the suggestions @username.

This action automatically triggers a zap that creates a new issue in the <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost\">mattermost repository</a>.</li>\n<li>To accept a ticket as a Help Wanted issue, the description should be unambiguous, and include UI description and help text so the change can be implemented and tested by any contributor.</li>\n<li>The Triage team also adds the appropriate difficulty level (one of <code>Introductory</code>, <code>Intermediate</code> and <code>Advanced</code>) and programming language (<code>Go</code> and <code>ReactJS</code>) to the description of the Jira ticket.</li>\n<li>After triage, the PM on community rotation reviews formatting of the GitHub issue and adds appropriate labels for difficulty level and programming language as defined by the Triage team.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/issues/4755\">See an example Help Wanted issue here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Managing Help Wanted Issues</h3>\n<p>Once a Help Wanted issue is added, the PM on community rotation is responsible for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Answering questions from community members, which get automatically posted in the <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/community-heartbeat\">Community Heartbeat channel</a>.</li>\n<li>Following up with a community member if there hasn't been a response for more than two weeks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Closing Help Wanted Issues</h3>\n<p>Once a pull request for an open GitHub Help Wanted issue is merged, please ensure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The corresponding GitHub Help Wanted issue is closed, thanking the contributor.</li>\n<li>The corresponding Jira ticket is resolved.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Help Wanted Issue Links</h3>\n<p>Below is a list of permanent redirects to Help Wanted issue queries:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>mattermost</code> -

For example, instead of \"Hackfest has started!\" say \"Hackfest starts now!\"</li>\n<li><strong>Include at most one link.</strong> To provide a clear call to action, include at most one link per tweet and place it near the end of the tweet.</li>\n<li><strong>Use exclamation marks only for exciting announcements.</strong> An exclamation mark can be used when the announcement is exciting, but using an exclamation mark should be avoided when it can be confused with a signal for community to panic, e.g. \"Security update released!\".</li>\n<li><strong>Be welcoming.</strong> When asking someone to take action, use \"Would you be open to\" instead of \"Would you like to\".</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Response Writing Tips</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>When to like (heart) a tweet where Mattermost is mentioned?</li>\n<li>Our team is on site at an event and tags our handle.</li>\n<li>A community member shares an event we are at, received a Mattermug, or shared a positive experience and mentions us.</li>\n<li>When to retweet a post?</li>\n<li>A community member released an integration and mentions us.</li>\n<li>Mattermug tweets from community members.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Sample Responses</h3>\n<h4>Requests for more information such as a preview of our product.</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thank you for your interest in Mattermost.

        "content": "# Social engagement guidelines\n\nThis playbook outlines the processes and practices used to engage with the Mattermost community across social community channels.\n\n## Goal\n\n[Earn trust](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles) and improve the Mattermost brand by responding to all Mattermost mentions and questions asked online in a timely manner. We want to help members of the community with their questions, but also making sure that the community is heard and that the feedback from the community reaches the rest of the team at Mattermost.\n\n## Expectations\n\nThe Community Team is responsible for monitoring and responding to mentions across social media. However, mentions will often require input from someone with specific domain knowledge to ensure we give an accurate response. In these cases, it is expected for subject matter experts within the company to help the community team craft responses.\n\nWe understand that everyone is busy, and that these types of requests can often seem like an unnecessary interruption. To mitigate this, the Community Team does the following before asking for assistance:\n\n1. Search the documentation, Mattermost, the forum, and GitHub issues to see if the question/concern has already been answered.\n\n2. Redirect the user to more appropriate support channels if the mention seems like it will require in-depth analysis or excessive back-and-forth. \n\nThis allows us to respond to the majority of our mentions without help, but there are still times when input from subject matter experts can help us respond much more quickly and accurately.\n\n## Can you help respond to this?\n\nWe're asking for help responding to this comment so we can ensure we give the best possible answer as quickly as possible. We want to make sure the wider community has the best possible experience when reaching out to us online.\n\n## General guidelines\n\n_Adopted from_ [https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/contributors/community-playbook\\#response-writing-tips](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/contributors/community-playbook#response-writing-tips)\n\nUltimately, when responding to users you should always keep the Golden Rule in mind -- if you were the person on the other end, how would you want someone to respond to you?\n\n1. **Be professional**\n   * Maintain professionalism in your responses, as you are speaking as a member of the company. Avoid slang or colloquialisms that may not translate well across other languages.\n   * Do not use humor in your responses, as it can be received in the wrong way by the community. Instead, stay factual when answering questions.\n2. **Don't answer if unsure**\n   * Ask someone who knows the answer instead of replying with an assumption or incomplete understanding.\n   * Don't be afraid to reroute if you don't have the answer and are having trouble figuring it out. A good place to start is the [Mattermost peer-to-peer help channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/peer-to-peer-help).\n3. **Choose over-communication vs. under-communication**\n   * Providing as much knowledge, context, and documentation up-front can reduce the number of interactions needed for the conversation to be satisfied.\n   * Make reducing frustration a priority; e.g., if you need to ask someone else for an answer and think it might take some time to discuss, inform the user so they can expect a delayed response.\n4. **Don't make promises**\n   * Avoid saying \u201cwe\u2019ll work on it\u201d or something similar that sets expectations that aren\u2019t met later. Instead, direct them to our [Feature Proposal Page](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/contributors/ways-to-contribute) or [Bug Filing Page](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/contributors/ways-to-contribute) if applicable.\n5. **Choose positivity over negativity**\n   * Turn a missing feature into an invitation to share a feature idea to be upvoted.\n   * Avoid excuses like \u201cwe\u2019re busy\u201d or \u201cour team is small.\"\n6. **Do your best to link documentation as answers**\n   * Links to documentation allow answers to be easily updated dynamically as documentation is updated.\n   * Any questions that should be answered in docs that aren\u2019t should turn into [tickets to create that documentation](https://github.com/mattermost/docs/issues) \\(with a link to the ticket included in the response\\).\n7. **Keep community end-user information secure**\n   * If you come across a post that includes the person's IP address, domain name, or other information you think should not be disclosed publicly, edit the post to remove this information.

        "html": "<h1>Social engagement guidelines</h1>\n<p>This playbook outlines the processes and practices used to engage with the Mattermost community across social community channels.</p>\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles\">Earn trust</a> and improve the Mattermost brand by responding to all Mattermost mentions and questions asked online in a timely manner. We want to help members of the community with their questions, but also making sure that the community is heard and that the feedback from the community reaches the rest of the team at Mattermost.</p>\n<h2>Expectations</h2>\n<p>The Community Team is responsible for monitoring and responding to mentions across social media. However, mentions will often require input from someone with specific domain knowledge to ensure we give an accurate response. In these cases, it is expected for subject matter experts within the company to help the community team craft responses.</p>\n<p>We understand that everyone is busy, and that these types of requests can often seem like an unnecessary interruption. To mitigate this, the Community Team does the following before asking for assistance:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Search the documentation, Mattermost, the forum, and GitHub issues to see if the question/concern has already been answered.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Redirect the user to more appropriate support channels if the mention seems like it will require in-depth analysis or excessive back-and-forth. </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This allows us to respond to the majority of our mentions without help, but there are still times when input from subject matter experts can help us respond much more quickly and accurately.</p>\n<h2>Can you help respond to this?</h2>\n<p>We're asking for help responding to this comment so we can ensure we give the best possible answer as quickly as possible. We want to make sure the wider community has the best possible experience when reaching out to us online.</p>\n<h2>General guidelines</h2>\n<p><em>Adopted from</em> <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/contributors/community-playbook#response-writing-tips\">https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/contributors/community-playbook#response-writing-tips</a></p>\n<p>Ultimately, when responding to users you should always keep the Golden Rule in mind -- if you were the person on the other end, how would you want someone to respond to you?</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Be professional</strong></li>\n<li>Maintain professionalism in your responses, as you are speaking as a member of the company. Avoid slang or colloquialisms that may not translate well across other languages.</li>\n<li>Do not use humor in your responses, as it can be received in the wrong way by the community. Instead, stay factual when answering questions.</li>\n<li><strong>Don't answer if unsure</strong></li>\n<li>Ask someone who knows the answer instead of replying with an assumption or incomplete understanding.</li>\n<li>Don't be afraid to reroute if you don't have the answer and are having trouble figuring it out. A good place to start is the <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/peer-to-peer-help\">Mattermost peer-to-peer help channel</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Choose over-communication vs. under-communication</strong></li>\n<li>Providing as much knowledge, context, and documentation up-front can reduce the number of interactions needed for the conversation to be satisfied.</li>\n<li>Make reducing frustration a priority; e.g., if you need to ask someone else for an answer and think it might take some time to discuss, inform the user so they can expect a delayed response.</li>\n<li><strong>Don't make promises</strong></li>\n<li>Avoid saying \u201cwe\u2019ll work on it\u201d or something similar that sets expectations that aren\u2019t met later. Instead, direct them to our <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/contributors/ways-to-contribute\">Feature Proposal Page</a> or <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/contributors/ways-to-contribute\">Bug Filing Page</a> if applicable.</li>\n<li><strong>Choose positivity over negativity</strong></li>\n<li>Turn a missing feature into an invitation to share a feature idea to be upvoted.</li>\n<li>Avoid excuses like \u201cwe\u2019re busy\u201d or \u201cour team is small.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Do your best to link documentation as answers</strong></li>\n<li>Links to documentation allow answers to be easily updated dynamically as documentation is updated.</li>\n<li>Any questions that should be answered in docs that aren\u2019t should turn into <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/docs/issues\">tickets to create that documentation</a> (with a link to the ticket included in the response).</li>\n<li><strong>Keep community end-user information secure</strong></li>\n<li>If you come across a post that includes the person's IP address, domain name, or other information you think should not be disclosed publicly, edit the post to remove this information. Then click the hide revision button so that your edits won't be visible to others on the forum.</li>\n<li><strong>Be welcoming and thankful</strong></li>\n<li>When asking someone to take action, use \"Would you be open to...\" instead of \"Would you like to...\".</li>\n<li>Communities really respond well to being praised and thanked for their work.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Community Forums</h2>\n<p>Below are guidelines or processes for specific forums we engage with the Mattermost community.</p>\n<h3>Twitter</h3>\n<p><strong>Intended outcomes</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Likes and loves:</strong> Every promoter feels appreciated (like, heart, etc.) and we have acknowledged the best content (re-tweet, quoted re-tweet, mention, shout out, replies, * humor, etc.).</li>\n<li><strong>Listening and respond:</strong> Everyone with a relevant question gets a reply in 1 business day (except trolls).</li>\n<li><strong>Data, learning, and iteration:</strong> Understand how we're doing week-to-week, what we've learned, and how we'll up-level our approach.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Workflow</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Monitor <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/twitter\">Twitter channel in Mattermost Contributors Team</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=mattermost&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live\">this search query</a>.</li>\n<li>Respond to questions, retweet, and like posts that we are tagged in per the guidelines outlined above.</li>\n<li>For product inquiries you are uncertain how to answer, you may escalate by at-mentioning <code>@pmteam</code> in the Twitter channel header.</li>\n<li>Update posts in the Twitter channel with action taken.</li>\n<li>React with <code>:heart:</code> if you liked the post.</li>\n<li>React with <code>:repeat:</code> if you retweeted the post.</li>\n<li>React with <code>:no_entry_sign:</code> if you took no action.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Response writing tips</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Avoid acronyms.</strong> Avoid acronyms when possible.

Please see the [Mattermost Contribution Guide](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/) which describes the process for making code contributions across Mattermost projects and [join our Contributors community channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/tickets) to ask questions from community members and the Mattermost core team.\n\nWhen you submit a pull request, it goes through a [code review process outlined here](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/code-review/).\n\nAll contributions must adhere to the following Code of Conduct. \n\n### We also expect you to adhere to our [Community Expectations](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/good-decisions/) guidelines while participating within the Mattermost community.\n\n## [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/mattermost/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n\n### Our Pledge\n\nWe as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.\n\nWe pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.\n\n### Our Standards\n\nExamples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:\n\n* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people\n* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences\n* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback\n* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,\n\n  and learning from the experience\n\n* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the\n\n  overall community\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior include:\n\n* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or\n\n  advances of any kind\n\n* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\n* Public or private harassment\n* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email\n\n  address, without their explicit permission\n\n* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a\n\n  professional setting\n\n### Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.\n\n## Enforcement\n\n### Reporting a Violation\n\nThere are several ways you can report a Code of Conduct violation:\n\n* On the Mattermost Community server: Send a direct message to @mattermostconduct.\n  * If the violation is in a public or private channel, include a link to the conversation being reported.\n  * If the violation is in a direct message conversation, provide screenshots.\n* On the Mattermost forum: Send a message to [@mattermostconduct](https://forum.mattermost.com/u/mattermostconduct/).\n* Email [conduct@mattermost.com](mailto:community@mattermost.com).\n\nAll complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.\n\nAll community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.\n\n**All reports will remain anonymous**. The exception is direct message violations: while we cannot provide reporter anonymity in those situations, they will be handled with extra care so as to not escalate the situation. A draft of the violation message will be sent to the reporter for final review before it is sent.\n\n### Enforcement Responsibilities\n\nCommunity leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\nCommunity leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.\n\nWhile the Community leaders are responsibile for handling violations, we ask that you do your best to immediately disengage and report infractions quickly to ensure situations do not escalate.\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\nCommunity leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:\n\n#### 1. Correction\n\n**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\n\n**Consequence:** A private written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\n\n#### 2. Warning\n\n**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.\n\n**Consequence:** A private written warning from community leaders with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.\n\n#### 3. Temporary Ban\n\n**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.\n\n**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n\n#### 4. Permanent Ban\n\n**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, aggression toward, or disparagement of, classes of individuals.\n\n**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.0, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code\\_of\\_conduct.html](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html).\n\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's Code of Conduct Enforcement Ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).\n\nFor answers to common questions about this Code of Conduct, see the FAQ at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq).

        "content": "# The Mattermost Community Writing Program\n\nMattermost wants to be a central resource for helping developers improve their productivity. To that end, we want to open our blog to our diverse community to share expertise, tips and tricks, guides, and other technical resources that help developers get work done. We\u2019ll compensate authors whenever we publish their content. \n\n## About you\n\nWe\u2019re looking for a diverse group of skilled writers with deep technical knowledge to write content for us. You should have experience writing content, be comfortable receiving feedback about your work, and be open to making revisions recommended by our editorial team. We typically prefer content that targets beginner to intermediate software developers, but we are open to a range of technical depth.\n\n## Preferred Topics\nThe following technologies and topics are our preferred focus areas. Articles that fit into one of these categories will be given higher priority:\n* Kubernetes and related technologies\n* Golang application development\n* CI/CD tooling for release management, test automation, and software deployment\n* Security tooling\n* Observability and performance monitoring\n* Software development productivity hacks.\n* Tips and tricks for popular software development tools.\n* Devops at scale\n\n## Other topics\n\nWe seek a broad range of technical content for software developers that provide rich detail about popular tools, and we will consider exceptional proposals for topics not listed above. If you think you have a great idea that doesn't fit into one of these categories, please apply!\n\n## Compensation\n\nMost authors receive $250 - $350 for publishing unique content, but exceptionally detailed content about prevalent technologies can earn up to $500. We also run regular events that offer bonuses for writing about specific topics.\n\n## The process\n\n1. **Submit your idea**: ~~Submit your idea via our [application form](https://form.asana.com/?k=S5-Dbo0LVh8y4kmGJ1QPvg&d=279683980846511) with an outline of your content and a previous writing example demonstrating your technical knowledge and writing capabilities. We will only publish unique, first-run content where our blog is the first platform for it to be published.~~ **Submissions are currently closed and the application form is disabled. Submissions will reopen at a future date and this page will update when that happens.**\n2. **Refine**:Our editorial team reviews all submissions once every 3 months to identify topics we want to publish. We will reach out to you to provide feedback on the idea and make any structural changes requests.\n3. **Write your content**: Once we\u2019ve approved your topic, it\u2019s time to write the content. We'll provide additional guidelines and expectations to help you get started, but generally speaking, following Digital Ocean's [technical writing guidelines](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/digitalocean-s-technical-writing-guidelines) is a good plan.\n4. **Revise**: Submit your initial draft to our editors, and we\u2019ll collaborate with you to copyedit, design a hero image, and prepare the article for publication. You should expect 1-2 rounds of revisions over the next 1-2 weeks.\n5. **Publish**: Once revisions are complete, we\u2019ll send your compensation, publish the article, and promote it across all of our channels.\n6. **Do it again**: There\u2019s no limit to the number of articles you can publish through this program. We love to build long-term relationships with our community and would love for you to be a repeat author on our blog. Start at step 1 again and keep going!\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**How do I get involved?**\n\nReview our [process for submitting ideas](#the-process). When you submit a new idea, we\u2019re going to ask you for details like:\n\n* The article title and a summary of its contents.\n* An outline of your article with descriptions about what each section of the article will cover.\n* Information about prerequisite knowledge the reader will need to have.\n* A link to a previous writing sample that demonstrates your capabilities.\n\nOur editorial staff will reach out to let you know if we want to publish your content and will make recommendations for revisions. Once we\u2019ve agreed that we\u2019re happy with the idea, we\u2019ll send you a contract that agrees on the scope of the article and the compensation. From there, it\u2019s up to you to write the first draft and submit it for review!\n\n**How do you evaluate content ideas?**\n\nOur team reviews every submission, and we look for technical content that comprehensively covers software development topics with clear explanations. Explain as much detail as possible and leave no concepts out.\n\n**When can I expect to hear about my submission?**\nOur topic review cycles happen once every three months, in the 2nd half of the months of March, June, September, and December. In most cases, you will first hear from us following one of these review periods. However, we sometimes make exceptions on a case-by-case basis as proposals are submitted to us, so we sometimes reach out to authors outside of the official review periods.\n\n**Is there a limit on article length?**\n\nGenerally speaking, all content should be an appropriate length to comprehensively cover the proposed topic, so we take a relatively relaxed approach to article length requirements. Ideally, most content should contain between 1,800 and 2,200 words, not counting code examples. We will consider content that is outside this range, but if you expect your content to exceed 2,200 words, please check with our editorial staff first so we can provide feedback. If you provide a draft that is more than 2,200 words, we may ask you to reduce the length before we will continue the process.\n\n## Terms and Conditions\n\nMattermost Community Writing Program Standard Terms & Conditions (\u201cWriting Program Terms\u201d):\n\n1. Mattermost can only accept submissions from individuals who can legally receive payments from Mattermost. Before your proposal can be approved you will be required to verify your legal status and ability to accept payment under the laws of the United States. You will be responsible for all applicable taxes owed on the fees paid under this Program. Mattermost will not be responsible for any withholding.\n1. All fee determinations under the program are made at the sole discretion of Mattermost.\n1. Your submission of content to Mattermost does not in any way establish any sort of employment relationship between you and Mattermost. Your relationship with Mattermost is that of an independent contractor and not that of an employee.\n1. You agree to grant Mattermost a perpetual, non-revocable, license to the content you submit to Mattermost.\n1. All content submitted to Mattermost under this program shall be licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International ([CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)) license.\n1. You agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including copyright laws.\n1. You agree to comply with the terms and conditions of the [Mattermost Terms of Service](https://mattermost.com/terms-of-service/).\n1. In no event shall Mattermost be liable with respect to any subject matter relating to this agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for special, incidental, consequential  or direct damages.\n1. Mattermost makes no representation or warranty of any kind. You represent and warrant that your content will not infringe upon or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party.\n1. This program is governed by the laws of the State of California.\n1. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Mattermost and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and they may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of Mattermost, or by the posting by Mattermost of a revised version.\n\nBy submitting your application to the Mattermost Community Writing Program you are agreeing to these Writing Program Terms and the [Mattermost Privacy Policy](https://mattermost.com/privacy-policy/).\n\n## Plagiarism policy\n\nThe Mattermost blog produces original, first-run content that has never been published previously in any form, digital or physical. All code, copy, images, and other content should be the result of the author's original thought, work, research, and self-expression. At our discretion, Mattermost will cease all work \u2014 possibly without notice \u2014 with any author that reproduces, copies, or claims someone else's work as their own. This policy extends to content that has been published, or is in the process of being published, by the author elsewhere without prior permission from Mattermost. This policy includes borrowing content, wording, code, documentation, or organizational structure from any other person or organization's prior work.\n\nSome examples of plagiarism include:\n\n* Rewording existing blog posts to pass the content as your own.\n* Copy and pasting external documentation without directly referencing the documentation source.\n* Modifying someone else's code to change variable and/or function names, comments, or other elements.\n* Using images from another source, even if you make modifications to that image.\n* Failing to attribute content or datasets published under permissive licenses like the Creative Commons License.\n\nIf you're unsure about a question or concern related to plagiarism, please consult with the Mattermost content team before submission.\n\n## Image use guidance\n\nYou may want to include images or other graphics to support your content in many situations.\n\nOur design team will produce original artwork to serve as the hero image for your blog post, so you don\u2019t need to provide images for this purpose. You\u2019re free to include images in the body of your content; however, all images you submit must meet one of two criteria:\n\n* The image must be 100% unique, original content, for which you are the copyright owner.\n* The image must be permissively licensed under the International Creative Commons License or other similar licenses.\n\nWhen using permissively-licensed images, you must provide a reference to the source to give proper attribution in the article. You\u2019re welcome to provide references to use as inspiration, but please indicate that these references aren\u2019t your original work when appropriate. In all situations, we reserve the right to recreate the images to fit the style of our blog or to improve the image as necessary.\n\n## Diagrams and flowcharts\n\nDiagrams and flowcharts are a great way to illustrate complicated technical details that include many components. If you\u2019re capable of creating clean, easy-to-understand charts, you\u2019re welcome to create original artwork to add to your content. If you have an idea for a diagram that would support your content but lack the skills or tools to create one, you can also include a rough sketch of your idea, and our design team can turn that into an attractive graphic. However, we have a limited capacity for this service, so we may need to adjust your idea to accommodate.\n\nIf you need help designing a diagram or flowchart, [this article has a ton of great information](https://www.smartdraw.com/flowchart/flowchart-tips.htm). Don\u2019t forget, all materials you include in the illustration must meet our licensing requirements.\n\n## Screenshots\n\nScreenshots can be a great way to show visual representations of the instructions in your article. You might want to include screenshots of terminal output, tool configurations, or other items related to your content. If you have screenshots in your content, ensure that all content that appears in the image is your unique work and doesn\u2019t include copyrighted images or other content from other sources.\n\nTo get the best screenshot, increase the font size of the text displayed in the image to something easily readable from a distance, crop screenshots to focus on elements relevant to the text, and remove unnecessary details when possible.\n",

We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Mattermost takes violations of our policy seriously and will respond appropriately.   \n  \nAll participants of Mattermost events must abide by the following policy: \n\n* Be excellent to each other. We want the event to be an excellent experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected categories. \n\n* Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that everyone deserves to be here \u2013 and each of us has the right to enjoy our experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or via micro-aggressions.  \n* Jokes shouldn\u2019t demean others. Consider what you are saying and how it would feel if it were said to or about you.  \n* Speak up if you see or hear something. Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when you or others are disrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged.  \n* If a participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from the event with no refund.  \n* If you are being harassed or feel uncomfortable, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately. \n\n_Harassment is not tolerated_. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: verbal language that reinforces social structures of domination related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected categories; sexual imagery in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; offensive verbal language; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. \n\nPractice saying \"Yes and\" to each other. It\u2019s a theatre improv technique to build on each other\u2019s ideas. We all benefit when we create together. This policy extends to talks, forums, workshops, social media, parties, hallway conversations, all attendees, partners, sponsors, volunteers, event staff, etc. You catch our drift. Mattermost reserves the right to refuse admittance to, or remove any person from, any Mattermost hosted event \\(including future Mattermost events\\) at any time in its sole discretion. This includes, but is not limited to, attendees behaving in a disorderly manner or failing to comply with this policy, and the terms and conditions herein. If a participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from the event with no refund.   \n  \nOur event staff can usually be identified by special badges/attire. Our policy means that we will look into and review every allegation of violation of our policy and respond appropriately. Please note, while we take all concerns raised seriously, we will use our discretion as to determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents, and may decline to take any further action and/or may direct the participant to other resources for resolution.   \n  \nEvent staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue/event security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing discomfort or harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance. \n\nExhibiting partners, sponsors or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to this policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff \\(including volunteers\\) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment. Participants and exhibiting partners or sponsors disobeying this policy will be notified and are expected to stop any offending behavior immediately. \n\n_Why this policy is important -_ Harassment at events and in online communities is unfortunately common. Creating an official policy aims to improve this by making it clear that harassment of anyone for any reason is not acceptable within our events and communities. This policy may prevent harassment by clearly defining expectations for behavior, aims to provide reassurance, and encourages people who have had bad experiences at other events to participate in this one.   \n  \n_License and attribution  -_ This policy is licensed under the Creative Commons Zero license.

Since our team is scattered all over the globe, we try to plan a different location for each MatterCon.\n\nMatterCon is **not** a mandatory trip or a department offsite, nor is it a vacation or incentive trip. It's a chance for everyone to meet fellow Mattermost team-members across all departments and regions: part team building, part education, part community building, and hopefully all fun. This is a work trip with fun mixed in.\n\n### Goal\n\nOur goal is to increase the share of Mattermost in the market by increasing effectiveness, efficiency and communication of our organization through:\n\n* Building and strengthening relationships.\n* Increasing alignment through understanding of objectives, process and domain topics.\n* Reflecting on and improving processes and plans.\n* Creating a fun culture for contributors and team members.\n* Breaking down work barriers and become more empathetic for team and community members around the world.\n\n### Who\n\nAll Mattermost staff along with invited contributors.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nGeneral guidelines and information are on this page but our official Code of Conduct policy is [outlined on this page](https://handbook.mattermost.com/mattercon/mattermost-code-of-conduct). For the smooth operation of MatterCon, all attendees are asked to sign the code of conduct along with standard a waiver and consent for official conference photography.\n\n### Contribute\n\n**Leisure time around contribute**\n\n* MatterCon is a work trip, not an incentive trip and should be treated as an opportunity to get to know the Mattermost team better.\n* If you want to enjoy the facilities or the area around it, feel free to book an extra day or more _before or after_ MatterCon.\n* The MatterCon team will plan \"regular work time\" for you to do regular work such as handling emails. Do not expect to have a normal days work during this week.\n* When you sign up for the activities, you agree to show up. We ask that everyone be accountable to showing up on time and be present for things they have committed to out of respect for your team members and money spent to save you a spot.\n* If you for some reason can no longer attend something you have committed to please cancel your booking or let the planning team know so we can offer your spot to another.\n* When you don't sign up at all, you understand that there will not be a ticket booked for you and there might be no room left in said activities.\n\n**Social media**\n\nYou are encouraged to take pictures and post on social media. If you take pictures of people not on the podium please ask their permission. Please consider using the hashtag \\#MatterCon.\n\n### Contribute sessions\n\nMatterCon has variety of sessions: workshops, presentations, etc. MatterCon isn\u2019t a conference, it's a \"meeting of minds\u201d. It's a place to connect and collaborate in an environment where everyone can contribute. We don\u2019t present to our users and customers, or schedule special/VIP time with them. They are expected to join in the overall program.\n\n**Team sessions/time**\n\nThis is scheduled time for teams to have team-only time to discuss their work, strategize, and problem solve.\n\n* Functional groups meet together \\(e.g. East Sales, Pipe-to-Spend, Site Reliability Engineering, etc.\\)\n* Cross-functional groups meet together \\(e.g. Plan, Create, Verify, etc.\\)\n* Customers meet together without any Mattermost team-members in the room to talk freely to each other.\n\n**Random tips**\n\n* Tip: Label your charger, or other belongings, with your name for easy return to owner in case you lose it.\n* Name badges should include home city, pronoun, company, hugs, how many contributes attended.\n* Check the packing list \\(coming soon\\) for what to bring.\n\n### Past MatterCons\n\nMatterCon 2022 was held at the Hilton resort in Bridgetown, Barbados.\n\nMatterCon 2021 was Mattermost's first VR conference and was held virtually.\n\n[Here are the lightning talks from MatterCon 2021.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obLMOBfImX0&list=PL-jqvaPsjQpOlydfk-W9fC9JZnOLDshIv)\n\nMatterCon 2020 was held at the Melia Nassau Beach resort in Nassau, Bahamas:\n\n[MatterCon 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA3DK0u2L4)\n\nHere's what it was like at MatterCon 2019 in Puta Cana, Dominican Republic:\n\n[MatterCon 2019](https://youtu.be/pMySvCfy7Bw)\n\nHere's MatterCon 2018 in Lisbon, Portugal:\n\n[MatterCon 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZXaYttz3NA&t=2s)\n\nHere's MatterCon 2017 in Las Vegas, USA:\n\n[MatterCon 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RpmrM-5UFY&t=65s)\n\n",

This is a work trip with fun mixed in.</p>\n<h3>Goal</h3>\n<p>Our goal is to increase the share of Mattermost in the market by increasing effectiveness, efficiency and communication of our organization through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Building and strengthening relationships.</li>\n<li>Increasing alignment through understanding of objectives, process and domain topics.</li>\n<li>Reflecting on and improving processes and plans.</li>\n<li>Creating a fun culture for contributors and team members.</li>\n<li>Breaking down work barriers and become more empathetic for team and community members around the world.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who</h3>\n<p>All Mattermost staff along with invited contributors.</p>\n<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>\n<p>General guidelines and information are on this page but our official Code of Conduct policy is <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/mattercon/mattermost-code-of-conduct\">outlined on this page</a>. For the smooth operation of MatterCon, all attendees are asked to sign the code of conduct along with standard a waiver and consent for official conference photography.</p>\n<h3>Contribute</h3>\n<p><strong>Leisure time around contribute</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>MatterCon is a work trip, not an incentive trip and should be treated as an opportunity to get to know the Mattermost team better.</li>\n<li>If you want to enjoy the facilities or the area around it, feel free to book an extra day or more <em>before or after</em> MatterCon.</li>\n<li>The MatterCon team will plan \"regular work time\" for you to do regular work such as handling emails. Do not expect to have a normal days work during this week.</li>\n<li>When you sign up for the activities, you agree to show up. We ask that everyone be accountable to showing up on time and be present for things they have committed to out of respect for your team members and money spent to save you a spot.</li>\n<li>If you for some reason can no longer attend something you have committed to please cancel your booking or let the planning team know so we can offer your spot to another.</li>\n<li>When you don't sign up at all, you understand that there will not be a ticket booked for you and there might be no room left in said activities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Social media</strong></p>\n<p>You are encouraged to take pictures and post on social media. If you take pictures of people not on the podium please ask their permission. Please consider using the hashtag #MatterCon.</p>\n<h3>Contribute sessions</h3>\n<p>MatterCon has variety of sessions: workshops, presentations, etc. MatterCon isn\u2019t a conference, it's a \"meeting of minds\u201d. It's a place to connect and collaborate in an environment where everyone can contribute. We don\u2019t present to our users and customers, or schedule special/VIP time with them. They are expected to join in the overall program.</p>\n<p><strong>Team sessions/time</strong></p>\n<p>This is scheduled time for teams to have team-only time to discuss their work, strategize, and problem solve.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Functional groups meet together (e.g. East Sales, Pipe-to-Spend, Site Reliability Engineering, etc.)</li>\n<li>Cross-functional groups meet together (e.g. Plan, Create, Verify, etc.)</li>\n<li>Customers meet together without any Mattermost team-members in the room to talk freely to each other.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Random tips</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tip: Label your charger, or other belongings, with your name for easy return to owner in case you lose it.</li>\n<li>Name badges should include home city, pronoun, company, hugs, how many contributes attended.</li>\n<li>Check the packing list (coming soon) for what to bring.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Past MatterCons</h3>\n<p>MatterCon 2022 was held at the Hilton resort in Bridgetown, Barbados.</p>\n<p>MatterCon 2021 was Mattermost's first VR conference and was held virtually.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obLMOBfImX0&amp;list=PL-jqvaPsjQpOlydfk-W9fC9JZnOLDshIv\">Here are the lightning talks from MatterCon 2021.</a></p>\n<p>MatterCon 2020 was held at the Melia Nassau Beach resort in Nassau, Bahamas:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA3DK0u2L4\">MatterCon 2020</a></p>\n<p>Here's what it was like at MatterCon 2019 in Puta Cana, Dominican Republic:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/pMySvCfy7Bw\">MatterCon 2019</a></p>\n<p>Here's MatterCon 2018 in Lisbon, Portugal:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZXaYttz3NA&amp;t=2s\">MatterCon 2018</a></p>\n<p>Here's MatterCon 2017 in Las Vegas, USA:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RpmrM-5UFY&amp;t=65s\">MatterCon 2017</a></p>",

It's much longer than the cord that comes with your Oculus Headset. Also, you can plug that USB-C cord from your Oculus into your MacBook to give additional range from the plug in your wall. There's also in the experimental settings area, a way to set your \"real Desk\" so it is picked up by the Oculus and shows an outline of your standing desk in a virtual world so you don't bump into it. This helps so I can place the controllers down or lean my hands on my desk while in a virtual meeting.\n\n",

These keyword links are particularly helpful for new Mattermost staff members ramping up on Mattermost-specific terms and processes.\n\nWe often refer to these hyperlinked keywords as *autolinks* because they're created using a Mattermost plugin called [Autolink](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-autolink). \n\nTo add a new autolink on the Mattermost Community Server:\n\n1. Define the word and URL to autolink on. For example, the term ISP is linked to the [issue/solution process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-processes/issue-solution) documentation in the [Mattermost Handbook](https://handbook.mattermost.com).\n2. On the Mattermost Community Server in the [Community Configuration channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/community-configuration), ask to help add the new autolink to the Mattermost server. This ensures that everyone on the Mattermost Community Server benefits from having a quick definition at their fingertips when the term is used in messages and threads.

You don't have to work at Mattermost to submit an update or fix something that's caught your eye.\n\n## How do I know what to update?\n\n\"Update the Handbook\" is a term we use regularly at Mattermost but it's not always obvious exactly what to update or how. Here are some examples of what a Handbook update could be:\n\n* Updating your team page with new team members and AORs.\n* Adding a new page to describe a new process.\n* Updating existing content to accommodate a change in process, policy, or requirement.\n* Archiving old content that should be preserved for reference.\n\nUpdating the Handbook can be as easy as fixing a typo, or as complex as reorganizing an entire section. The key is to update it regularly, so that updates are less daunting and time-consuming.\n\n## Hints and tips\n\nThe Handbook is a public-facing body of work and although it's a constantly-evolving work-in-progress, we still need to ensure our content is accurate, easy to read, and clear.\n\n* **Be concise:** Say what's essential, not more.\n* **Get feedback:** Have someone from your target audience read your draft to share feedback so you can [savor surprises](../about-mattermost/mindsets.md#savor-surprises).\n* **Don't aim for perfection:** Our goal is regular iteration, so your content doesn't have to be perfect before it's published. It will be reviewed by an editor prior to publication so any major errors will be addressed then.\n\n## Your first Mattermost contribution\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to Mattermost, first read the [Mattermost Contributor Agreement](https://mattermost.com/mattermost-contributor-agreement/) and sign it \\(at the bottom of the page\\), so you can be added to the Mattermost [Approved Contributor List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NTCeG-iL_VS9bFqtmHSfwETo5f-8MQ7oMDE5IUYJi_Y/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true). Please ensure the **GitHub username** field matches your GitHub username exactly, including capitalization.\n\nIf you're not already a member of the `mattermost` GitHub organization, you can request access through the [Mattermost IT helpdesk](https://helpdesk.mattermost.com/support/home). This will allow you to edit the files in the Handbook repo without having to create a fork for your changes.\n\nNow you're ready to get started.\n\n## Edit an existing page\n\nWhen you edit an existing page, it's usually to add content, remove content, or edit existing content. In general it's easiest if pages are edited directly, although you're also welcome to [edit files directly from the repo](#edit-a-file-in-the-repo) if that's easier for you.\n\nAll editing is done in GitHub, as that's where the Handbook files are stored. Pages are formatted using Markdown - if you're not familiar with Markdown, you can take a look at [this page](https://docs.mattermost.com/messaging/formatting-text.html) for tips. Don't worry too much about formatting - it can always be adjusted during the review process.\n\nOnce a page is edited and you're happy with the changes, it's submitted as a pull request which is then reviewed. If there's any feedback or comments have been made, you'll be alerted. If suggestions have been made, you can choose to commit them (add them to your content) or you can ask the reviewer for more information before doing that.\n\nWhen the PR is approved, it'll be merged and published. If you have more changes to make, you can simply repeat the process.\n\n### Edit a page directly\n\nThis is probably the quickest way to make changes, as it doesn't require you to find the file in the repo first.\n\n1.  Login to your Mattermost GitHub account\n2. Open the Handbook and navigate to the page you want to edit.\n3. Underneath the blue banner, locate three dots next to the page title at the top of the page. Click on the three dots and choose **Edit on GitHub**. This action will open the page in GitHub.\n4. In GitHub select the pencil icon in the navigation bar \\(above the page header\\) called **Edit this file** to open the editable Markdown-format page. If you see **Edit this file in your fork of this project** the process is the same, it just means you're not part of the Mattermost organization and are working in a forked repo.\n   * To learn more about Markdown formatting, see the [Mattermost guide for formatting text](https://docs.mattermost.com/messaging/formatting-text.html), or [the guide from GitBook](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown).\n5. Make your edits. When you're ready to submit your changes, commit your changes to start a pull request.\n6. Add a descriptive title if the default title isn't sufficient. Add an extended description to summarize the changes you've made.\n7. The default setting is **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**. In the field below that, you can customize the branch name - you can also leave it as default.\n8. Select **Propose changes**.\n9. On the next page, you can scroll down to compare changes with the original document to double-check your changes. \n10. If you're happy with them confirm that the title and description are correct, then select **Create pull request**.\n\nOnce a pull request has been submitted, a core committer with write-access assigns relevant reviewers and labels to kick off the review process. The review process includes aligning the content with the Style Guide, validating the changes, and tagging any other relevant committers.\n\nMultiple committers may comment on your pull request and provide edits or suggestions which you can commit directly. You can also add line comments. Take a look at [Commenting on pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request) for more details.\n\nOnce the review process is complete, the change is merged and pushed live. We recommend that you review your changes at [https://handbook.mattermost.com](https://handbook.mattermost.com) for potential formatting errors.\n\n### Edit a file in the repo\n\nThis option works best if you know where the file is located in the repo.\n\n1. Open the [Handbook repo](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook).\n2. Navigate through the directories to the file you want to edit.\n3. Once you've found the file, select **Edit this file** in the top corner. If you see **Edit this file in your fork of this project** the process is the same, it just means you're not part of the Mattermost organization and are working in a forked repo.\n   * To learn more about Markdown formatting, see the [Mattermost guide for formatting text](https://docs.mattermost.com/messaging/formatting-text.html), or [the guide from GitBook](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown).\n5. Make your edits. When you're ready to submit your changes, commit your changes to start a pull request.\n6. Add a descriptive title if the default title isn't sufficient. Add an extended description to summarize the changes you've made.\n7. The default setting is **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**. In the field below that, you can customize the branch name - you can also leave it as default.\n8. Select **Propose changes**.\n9. On the next page, you can scroll down to compare changes with the original document to double-check your changes. \n10. If you're happy with them confirm that the title and description are correct, then select **Create pull request**.\n\n## Create a new page\n\nCreating new content can take the form of a new page, or [an entirely new section](create-a-new-section). Some things to keep in mind are naming conventions and that the Table of Contents entry is made manually in the `SUMMARY.md` file.\n\n1. Open the [Handbook repo](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook).\n2. Navigate through the directories until you reach the section where you'd like to add your new content.\n3. Select **Add file > Create new file**.\n\n  When you create a new page in the Handbook ensure that:\n\n  * The page name is all lowercase\n  * There are hyphens instead of spaces between the words.\n  * New page names end with `.md`.\n\n4. Write your content as needed.\n5. When you're ready to submit your changes, commit your changes to start a pull request.\n6. Add a descriptive title if the default title isn't sufficient. Add an extended description to summarize the changes you've made.\n7. The default setting is **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**. In the field below that, you can customize the branch name - you can also leave it as default.\n8. Select **Propose changes**.\n9. On the next page, you can scroll down to compare changes with the original document to double-check your changes. \n10. If you're happy with them confirm that the title and description are correct, then select **Create pull request**.\n11. Add your new page to the [Handbook table of contents](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/blob/0.2.1/SUMMARY.md). If you plan to reorder the table of contents as part of your change, please tag @jason.blais or @carrie.warner in Mattermost \\(@jasonblais or @cwarnermm in GitHub\\) as a redirect may need to be set up to accommodate the change.\n\n[Watch a two-minute training video on how to create a new page in GitHub](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12JUpEdP3uU_bPxDVWdlEZv65v1tttlQn/view?usp=sharing).\n\n## Create a new section\n\nIf you want to create nested content, you can create folders. You cannot create an empty folder and then add files to that folder, but rather creation of a folder must happen together with adding of at least a single file. On GitHub you can do it this way:\n\n1. Navigate to the folder within which you're creating your new folder.\n2. Select **Add file > Create new file**.\n3. Enter the new folder's name in the text field and add `/` at the end.\n4. In the next text box, enter the name of the new page, ending with `.md`.\n5. When you're ready to submit your changes, commit your changes to start a pull request.\n6. Add a descriptive title if the default title isn't sufficient. Add an extended description to summarize the changes you've made.\n7. The default setting is **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**. In the field below that, you can customize the branch name - you can also leave it as default.\n8. Select **Propose changes**.\n9. On the next page, you can scroll down to compare changes with the original document to double-check your changes. \n10. If you're happy with them confirm that the title and description are correct, then select **Create pull request**.\n11. Add your new section to the [Handbook table of contents](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/blob/0.2.1/SUMMARY.md). If you plan to reorder the table of contents as part of your change, please tag @jason.blais or @carrie.warner in Mattermost \\(@jasonblais or @cwarnermm in GitHub\\) as a redirect may need to be set up to accommodate the change.\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n### How do I format a page?\n\nAll Handbook pages are written in Markdown, which is also the language used to post messages in Mattermost. To learn more about Markdown formatting, see the [Mattermost guide for formatting text](https://docs.mattermost.com/messaging/formatting-text.html), or [the guide from GitBook](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown).\n\n### How do I update the left-hand navigation?\n\nYou can update the left-hand navigation in the [SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/blob/0.2.1/SUMMARY.md) file.\n\n**Important note:**\n\nGitBook dynamically changes the URL based on the location in the table of contents. This means that when a page changes its location, the previous link results in a 'page not found' error.\n\nThere is a redirect file that we use to prevent this in the `gitbook.yaml` file. Please mention @jason.blais or @carrie.warner in Mattermost \\(@jasonblais or @cwarnermm in GitHub\\) for assistance if needed.\n\n### How do I add an image to the documentation?\n\nFollow these two steps:\n\n* Go to the [/assets](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/tree/0.2.1/.gitbook/assets) folder, select **Upload files**, then upload the image files you want to add to your documentation. Make sure to have a clear name for each file you upload.\n* Next, go to the section you want to add an image to and include the following Markdown formatting:\n\n  ```text\n  ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/release-timeline-jan2020.png)\n  ```\n\n### Can I convert a Google Doc to Markdown?\n\nYes! Sometimes it's easier to draft content for the Handbook in a Google Doc. An open-source Google Drive add-on called [Docs to Markdown](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/docs_to_markdown/700168918607) can convert the content to Markdown. See the add-on [documentation](https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html/wiki) for details on installing and using this tool.\n\nOnce the add-on is installed, there are a number of conversion settings you can configure. Selecting all but the **Use HTML headings/IDs** option is recommended.\n\n- To see the embedded errors and warnings, disable the **Use reckless mode** option.\n- To see all conversion details, disable the **Suppress info comment** option.\n\nThe resulting Markdown code isn't perfect, but it's an excellent initial step towards preparing a PR for the Mattermost Handbook. Review the following areas of converted code:\n\n- Embedded images must be saved out as files, added to appropriate image folders, and links need to be added to point to correct locations.\n  - If the doc contains screenshots or other image assets, right-click on the embedded image in the Google Doc, then select **Save to Keep**.\n  - In the right pane, right-click on the image in the **Keep list**, then select **Save Image As**. Rename the image file as needed to match the Markdown code.\n\n- Images need to live in the `.gitbook/assets` folder and must use a relative link in the source file.\n- Numbered lists and nested lists likely need corrections.\n- Many lines end in a `/` which need to be removed.\n- ALT tags are added as `alt_text` for all images. Update the ALT tag to be more descriptive, or remove it altogether.\n\n## Training video\n\n[Watch a training video on how to update the handbook in GitHub](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AOI8H-oe2u1JW6oOA4nPPTSbGnK3Xuq1/view?usp=sharing).\n\n## Official Handbook reviewers\n\nBelow is a list of approved reviewers.\n\n1. @cwarnermm: Reviews major changes to handbook.mattermost.com, such as updates to the Table of Contents \\(SUMMARY.md\\).\n2. @cwarnermm: Editor reviews of all submitted PRs for correct grammar and consistent style.\n3. @kevinfayle: Signs off on changes to [marketing ops and analytics](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/messaging-and-math/demand-generation-reporting).\n4. @aedott: Signs off on changes to [messaging and math](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/messaging-and-math).\n5. @it33: Signs off on changes to [finance](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance).\n6. @natalie-hub: Signs off on changes to [workplace](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace).\n7. @it33: Signs off on changes to signing authority \\([example](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/pull/60)\\).\n8. @dschalla: Signs off on changes to [Security](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/security).\n\nEach PR should be reviewed by at least one approved reviewer. A build check requiring at least one approved review prior to a merge is planned, similar to other Mattermost repositories.\n\nBelow is a list of permissions handbook contributors have access to:\n\n1. @jasonblais, @amyblais, @cwarnermm: Write permissions to the repository.\n2. Staff contributors: Submit changes to `handbook.mattermost.com` using PRs. May have access to request reviews, add labels, submit PR reviews, and be requested as reviewers.\n3. Non-staff contributors: Submit changes to `handbook.mattermost.com` using PRs. Do not have access to request reviews, add labels. Can submit PR reviews.\n",

If you plan to reorder the table of contents as part of your change, please tag @jason.blais or @carrie.warner in Mattermost (@jasonblais or @cwarnermm in GitHub) as a redirect may need to be set up to accommodate the change.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/12JUpEdP3uU_bPxDVWdlEZv65v1tttlQn/view?usp=sharing\">Watch a two-minute training video on how to create a new page in GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h2>Create a new section</h2>\n<p>If you want to create nested content, you can create folders. You cannot create an empty folder and then add files to that folder, but rather creation of a folder must happen together with adding of at least a single file. On GitHub you can do it this way:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to the folder within which you're creating your new folder.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Add file &gt; Create new file</strong>.</li>\n<li>Enter the new folder's name in the text field and add <code>/</code> at the end.</li>\n<li>In the next text box, enter the name of the new page, ending with <code>.md</code>.</li>\n<li>When you're ready to submit your changes, commit your changes to start a pull request.</li>\n<li>Add a descriptive title if the default title isn't sufficient. Add an extended description to summarize the changes you've made.</li>\n<li>The default setting is <strong>Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request</strong>. In the field below that, you can customize the branch name - you can also leave it as default.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Propose changes</strong>.</li>\n<li>On the next page, you can scroll down to compare changes with the original document to double-check your changes. </li>\n<li>If you're happy with them confirm that the title and description are correct, then select <strong>Create pull request</strong>.</li>\n<li>Add your new section to the <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/blob/0.2.1/SUMMARY.md\">Handbook table of contents</a>. If you plan to reorder the table of contents as part of your change, please tag @jason.blais or @carrie.warner in Mattermost (@jasonblais or @cwarnermm in GitHub) as a redirect may need to be set up to accommodate the change.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>\n<h3>How do I format a page?</h3>\n<p>All Handbook pages are written in Markdown, which is also the language used to post messages in Mattermost. To learn more about Markdown formatting, see the <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/messaging/formatting-text.html\">Mattermost guide for formatting text</a>, or <a href=\"https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown\">the guide from GitBook</a>.</p>\n<h3>How do I update the left-hand navigation?</h3>\n<p>You can update the left-hand navigation in the <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/blob/0.2.1/SUMMARY.md\">SUMMARY.md</a> file.</p>\n<p><strong>Important note:</strong></p>\n<p>GitBook dynamically changes the URL based on the location in the table of contents. This means that when a page changes its location, the previous link results in a 'page not found' error.</p>\n<p>There is a redirect file that we use to prevent this in the <code>gitbook.yaml</code> file. Please mention @jason.blais or @carrie.warner in Mattermost (@jasonblais or @cwarnermm in GitHub) for assistance if needed.</p>\n<h3>How do I add an image to the documentation?</h3>\n<p>Follow these two steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to the <a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/tree/0.2.1/.gitbook/assets\">/assets</a> folder, select <strong>Upload files</strong>, then upload the image files you want to add to your documentation. Make sure to have a clear name for each file you upload.</li>\n<li>Next, go to the section you want to add an image to and include the following Markdown formatting:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>text\n  ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/release-timeline-jan2020.png)</code></p>\n<h3>Can I convert a Google Doc to Markdown?</h3>\n<p>Yes! Sometimes it's easier to draft content for the Handbook in a Google Doc. An open-source Google Drive add-on called <a href=\"https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/docs_to_markdown/700168918607\">Docs to Markdown</a> can convert the content to Markdown. See the add-on <a href=\"https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html/wiki\">documentation</a> for details on installing and using this tool.</p>\n<p>Once the add-on is installed, there are a number of conversion settings you can configure. Selecting all but the <strong>Use HTML headings/IDs</strong> option is recommended.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To see the embedded errors and warnings, disable the <strong>Use reckless mode</strong> option.</li>\n<li>To see all conversion details, disable the <strong>Suppress info comment</strong> option.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The resulting Markdown code isn't perfect, but it's an excellent initial step towards preparing a PR for the Mattermost Handbook. Review the following areas of converted code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Embedded images must be saved out as files, added to appropriate image folders, and links need to be added to point to correct locations.</li>\n<li>If the doc contains screenshots or other image assets, right-click on the embedded image in the Google Doc, then select <strong>Save to Keep</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the right pane, right-click on the image in the <strong>Keep list</strong>, then select <strong>Save Image As</strong>. Rename the image file as needed to match the Markdown code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Images need to live in the <code>.gitbook/assets</code> folder and must use a relative link in the source file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Numbered lists and nested lists likely need corrections.</li>\n<li>Many lines end in a <code>/</code> which need to be removed.</li>\n<li>ALT tags are added as <code>alt_text</code> for all images. Update the ALT tag to be more descriptive, or remove it altogether.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Training video</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AOI8H-oe2u1JW6oOA4nPPTSbGnK3Xuq1/view?usp=sharing\">Watch a training video on how to update the handbook in GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h2>Official Handbook reviewers</h2>\n<p>Below is a list of approved reviewers.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>@cwarnermm: Reviews major changes to handbook.mattermost.com, such as updates to the Table of Contents (SUMMARY.md).</li>\n<li>@cwarnermm: Editor reviews of all submitted PRs for correct grammar and consistent style.</li>\n<li>@kevinfayle: Signs off on changes to <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/messaging-and-math/demand-generation-reporting\">marketing ops and analytics</a>.</li>\n<li>@aedott: Signs off on changes to <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/messaging-and-math\">messaging and math</a>.</li>\n<li>@it33: Signs off on changes to <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance\">finance</a>.</li>\n<li>@natalie-hub: Signs off on changes to <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace\">workplace</a>.</li>\n<li>@it33: Signs off on changes to signing authority (<a href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/pull/60\">example</a>).</li>\n<li>@dschalla: Signs off on changes to <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/security\">Security</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each PR should be reviewed by at least one approved reviewer.

When correctly implemented it results in total alignment across organizations while executing at high speed. V2MOM \\(pronounced \u201cVee Two Mom\u201d\\) is an acronym for vision, priorities, methods, obstacles, and measures and is expressed as a one-page document communicating these five areas of a strategy.\n\nV2MOMs are the API resourcing and ROI measures at our company.\n\n## Structure\n\nWriting good V2MOMs is a critical skill for leadership in thinking through what they are asking of their organizations and concisely laying out how the organization should operate, make choices, and measure progress.\n\nWhen you write a V2MOM, imagine that you\u2019re posting it to both your organization and the company as a whole, and can have no further communication for the quarter. Your organization and its service providers within the company and outside the company, need to use your V2MOM to plan, prioritize, execute and make trade-offs during the quarter, and present to you at the end of the quarter what they have achieved based on what you have asked.\n\nAssume your team is high performance and will aspire to 150% of what\u2019s been required, but due to circumstances beyond their control they have achieved only 70% of what their own aspirations. Your V2MOM should ensure the right priorities were delivered, which feed into the V2MOMs across the company that depend on your success.\n\n**Vision**\n\n* One sentence definition of what we want to do\n\nThis is a summary sentence to concisely communicate priorities.\n\n**Priorities**\n\n* List of the most important parts of the vision in priority order\n\nWhen an organization needs to make trade-offs, the V2MOM tells it to cut the lower priorities in order to achieve the higher priorities.\n\n**Methods**\n\n* List of what\u2019s needed from everyone to get the job done\n\n**Obstacles**\n\n* List of key challenges to be overcome to achieve our vision\n\n**Measures**\n\n* List of desired results, often numerical\n\n## V2MOM Example\n\nVision\n\n* Operate efficiently with Standard Operating Procedures \\(SOPs\\) that are aligned, documented, easy-to-use and deliver value quickly\n\nPriorities\n\n* Alignment - SOPs should clearly align to vetted V2MOMs\n* Documentation - All SOPs found online through web search\n* Ease-of-use - Experience of using SOPs is fast, obvious and forgiving\n* Agreement - RAPID feedback and agreement achieved\n* Fast time-to-value - We move faster with SOPs, not slower\n\nMethods\n\n* Education on how to draft, RAPID review and publish SOPs\n* Table of Contents - Public list and link all SOPs at Operations section of handbook.mattermost.com\n* RAPID review - Update SOPs with RAPID stakeholder review\n* Onboard and train - Include onboarding, training for new and updated SOPs\n* SOP iteration - Measure, monitor and manage SOPs\n\nObstacles\n\n* Too many procedures stored in email, channels and tribal knowledge\n* Too many undocumented, unclear procedures\n* Duplicate, conflicted procedure documented\n* People not knowing about and/or following SOPs\n\nMeasures\n\n* All SOPs are clearly tied to a V2MOM\n* 90% of non-confidential SOPs can be found via a web search\n* &lt;5% error rate by SOP\n* 80% of SOPs document RAPID sign-off within last 12 months\n* NPS of 20+ on SOPs from users due to ease-of-use and speed\n\n**Commentary**\n\nIn this V2MOM \u201cAlignment\u201d is the top priority. We note in the obstacles that the organization suffers from duplicate and conflicting SOPs today. If there was only one thing achieved in this V2MOM during the quarter it would be aligning SOPs with V2MOMs. This is measured by \u201cAll SOPs are clearly tied to a V2MOM\u201d.\n\nThe next priority is \u201cDocumentation\u201d with a measure of \u201c90% of non-confidential SOPs can be found via a web search\u201d to surface SOPs to further ensure alignment and removing conflict.\n\nWe note here that Documentation and Alignment are interlinked, and that there are multiple ways we could have priorized the two. For example, if we have gaps in V2MOMs then Alignment this period might not be feasible and we could prioritize Documentation, and we may end up documenting duplicate and conflicting SOPs, but in doing so resolve them.\n\nWhen you write a V2MOM you need to decide how to prioritize the elements of your vision so that our organizations know how to make decisions. It\u2019s okay to get things wrong once in a while so long as we are right most of the time, and we can course correct when we make a mistake.\n\n## V2MOM Template\n\nThe following template is used to lock annual V2MOMs in one page.

        "content": "# List of Terms\n\n## Current Terms\n\nThe following lists current terms actively used at Mattermost. You can also see [Tombstoned Terms](list-of-terms.md#tombstoned-terms) for terms that have either been modified or deprecated. We use Tombstoned Terms to preserve links to previous definitions so clarity is maintained.\n\n### 0/5, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 5/5\n\nWe use \u201cx/5\u201d to concisely communicate conviction. 0/5 means you don\u2019t have a strong opinion, you are just sharing an idea or asking a question. 5/5 means you are highly confident and would stake your reputation on the opinion you\u2019re expressing.\n\nExample: \"0/5, I think before archiving a channel a user should type in the name of the channel to make sure they really want to do it\" expresses low conviction and indifference in the suggestion. The decision maker should feel free to ignore the input. As another example: \"4/5, I think before archiving a channel a user should type in the name of the channel to make sure they really want to do it\" expresses high conviction and the decision maker may want to ask more questions to understand whether [emotion, assumption, or priority](mindsets.md#emotion-assumption-and-priority) is behind the feedback.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nWe try not to use the term \"best practice\" at Mattermost, as it's counter-cultural to our focus on [iteration](list-of-terms.md#iteration), [self-awareness](./#leadership-principles), and [earn trust](./#leadership-principles). Iteration means there is always opportunity to grow and improve and so we never reach our \"best\".\n\n### AA\n\nRefers to both an [As Appropriate interview](../../contributors/join-us/recruiting.md#as-appropriate-interviews-aa-s) as well as the [As Appropriate interviewer](../../contributors/join-us/recruiting.md#as-appropriate-interviews-aa-s). Final interview required before making a decision on a new hire.\n\n### AOR\n\n_Area Of Responsibility_ defines the area for which a [DRI](list-of-terms.md#dri) is accountable. The [AOR page](../../operations/operations/areas-of-responsibility.md) provides information on AORs across the company.\n\n### ARR\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (\u201cARR\u201d) is a measurement for time-limited subscription contracts. ARR normalizes contracted recurring revenue into a one year period to allow for like-kind comparisons between contracts that have differing start/end dates and/or different contract lengths. In a recurring revenue model, ARR represents the anticipated total revenue from all active contracts for the future 12 months from any measurement period. \u201cActive\u201d is defined as starting from customer contract signing date, not subscription start date. ARR does not include revenue from non-recurring items such as one-time setup fees or professional services.\n\nFor example, total ARR from 3 separate customers would be as follows:\n\nCustomer A: 6-month contract totaling $60,000. ARR = $120,000 ($60,000/6 * 12)\nCustomer B: 12-month contract totaling $240,000. ARR = $240,000\nCustomer C: 15-month contract totaling $45,000. ARR = $36,000 ($45,000/15 * 12)\nTotal ARR for Company = $396,000 ($120,000 + $240,000 + $36,000)\n\n### Bookings\n\nThe ARR associated with sales transactions closed during the period. Note that Bookings and Billings are different, particularly for pro-rated contracts and multi-year contracts. Billings corresponds to the amount the customer is invoiced.\n\nFor example, Customer A signs a 3 year paid upfront transaction for $300,000. For Customer A, the bookings amount would be $100,000 ($300,000/3 years = ARR of $100,000) and the billings amount would be $300,000 (what we actually invoiced the customer at time of order signing). Customer B has a contract for 100 licenses at $50/year/license for 12 months, for total ARR of $5,000. They decide to add 25 more licenses after 4 months. For Customer B, the bookings amount would be $1,250 (25 * $50/year) and the billings amount would be $833.33 (25 * $50/year * 8 remaining months/12 months total contract).\n\n### Bug\n\nAn obvious error in Mattermost software that is typically a code defect. Changes required to accommodate unsupported third-party software \\(such as browsers or operating systems\\) are not considered bugs - they are considered improvements.\n\n### CAO\n\n_Contract Accountability Owner_ is a [DRI](list-of-terms.md#dri) for ensuring a contract meets our guidelines and standards ahead of final approval by [a company signatory](../../operations/operations/company-processes/company-agreements.md#who-can-sign-on-behalf-of-the-company). Also see [listing of CAOs](../../operations/operations/company-processes/company-agreements.md#who-are-contract-accountability-owners-caos).\n\n### Churn\n\nWhen an existing customer completely cancels and is no longer a continuing customer. Dollar value of ARR is $0 after the reduction.\n\n### COM\n\nCOM is short for [Customer Obsession Meeting](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html?#customer-obsession-all-hands-meeting), which is our \u201cAll Hands\u201d meeting focused on how we\u2019re aligning the company to serve our customers.\n\n### Contraction\n\nWhen an existing customer decreases the dollar value of their ARR, either by decreasing the number of licenses, decreasing the number of products and/or the discounting being applied is increased. Note that the decrease is classified as \u201ccontraction\u201d if there is still some amount of ARR remaining after the reduction.\n\n### Country/Region\n\nBecause the term \"country\" may be either controversial or incorrect when describing a geographic area governed by a state-like political entity we use the term \"country/region\" to avoid any accidental or implied judgement on the independence of a region. If the term \"country\" appears to be incorrectly used, when \"country/region\" is more appropriate, please contact info@mattermost.com.\n\n### Collapsed Reply Threads \\(CRT\\)\n\nCollapsed Reply Threads \\(CRT\\) is a Mattermost Messaging feature available in beta offering an enhanced experience for users communicating in threads and replying to messages. When enabled, Collapsed Reply Threads improve users\u2019 ability to process channel content, find, follow, and resume conversations more easily, and keep threaded conversations focused. See our [Organizing Conversations using Collapsed Reply Threads \\(Beta\\)](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/messaging/organizing-conversations.html) product documentation for details.\n\n### Core Committers\n\nCore committers are staff or community developers with the responsibility to contribute and review Mattermost source code.\n\n### CSM\n\nCustomer Success Management function at Mattermost responsible for retaining customer revenue, with quarterly & annual targets, including customer relationship management, executive relationships, and quarterly business reviews.\n\n### Customer\n\nThe primary external audience we are focused on for an initiative, which could be an end user without budget \\(if our goal is adoption and engagement\\) or a buyer \\(if our objective for the initiative is revenue\\). A customer does not include internal staff, since staff are not external.\n\n### Dark Actions\n\nThe act of using non-web-discoverable formats \\(Mattermost channels requiring login, Google docs that aren't web searchable, Zoom call, email, etc.\\) to share non-confidential information or processes.\n\nExample: Giving someone instructions on how to set up Okta for MFA on the community server in a DM rather than writing it into a handbook entry for all new staff to use and re-use.\n\nDark actions create [false openness](list-of-terms.md#false-openness). [Open actions](list-of-terms.md#open-actions) are highly preferred.\n\n### DE\n\nDeployment Engineering function at Mattermost responsible for accelerating seats deployed at $50K+ accounts, focusing on single customer pain points & needs by working directly with customers in partnership with post-sales and revenue retention teams, and providing expertise on how to run and deploy Mattermost and the platform as a whole.\n\n### Dead Tarzan\n\nDiscarding an imperfect solution without a clearly thought out and working alternative. Based on idea of [Tarzan of the Jungle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarzan) letting go of a vine without having a new vine to swing to.\n\n### Decking\n\nA term for shipping something that is far below quality standards. This term is used by mountain climbers to describe falling off the side of a mountain, which often involves a series of failures, not just one.\n\n### Dev Mana\n\nA specific type of [mana](list-of-terms.md#mana) for developers similar to \u201cpoints\u201d or \u201cjelly beans\u201d in an Agile/Scrum methodology. On average, full time Mattermost developers each complete tickets adding up to approximately 28 mana per week. A \u201csmall\u201d item is 2 mana, a \u201cmedium\u201d is 4, a \u201clarge\u201d is 8, and any project bigger needs to be broken down into smaller tickets.\n\n### DRI\n\n_Directly Responsible Individual_ means a human individual who is accountable for a given Area Of Responsibility. A DRI is a single person, not a group of people. If there is a shift schedule, define each shift as a separate AOR \\(e.g. Tier 2 Mobile Support Escalations Weekdays 8am to 5pm Palo Alto time\\). If you are unsure who is the DRI, make the AOR more specific until the DRI is clear.\n\n### Edge\n\n\u201cEdge Release\u201d, a version of Mattermost which indicates the latest unstable release off of the main branch.\n\n### ESR\n\n\u201cExtended Support Release\u201d, a version of Mattermost maintained for a longer period of time that will receive security fixes.\n\n### Expansion\n\nWhen an existing customer increases the dollar value of their ARR, either by adding licenses, adding additional products and/or reducing the discount being applied.\n\n### Expert Mode\n\nExpert Mode \\(also known as \"Crimson Force Field\"\\) is when documentation or on-screen text is written for someone with considerable knowledge or expertise, instead of being designed for a new learner. In general, try to state things simply rather than speaking to just the \u201cexperts\u201d reading the text.\n\nIf something is extremely difficult to understand, and yet still justified in the mind of the writer, we call it \u201cCrimson Force Field\u201d. This term is intended to evoke the emotional response of coming across something that is difficult to understand, so writers of Crimson Force Field material can empathize with the readers. Crimson Force Field is drawn from an esoteric episode of Star Trek and it is unlikely anyone but the originator of the term understands its complete meaning. Crimson Force Field is itself Crimson Force Field.\n\n### False Openness\n\nKeeping non-sensitive information that would be helpful for staff and community to know out of public web search through the use of dark actions. Often false openness is unintentional, though after staff members are educated on the topic and empowered to use [open actions](list-of-terms.md#open-actions), continued use of [dark actions](list-of-terms.md#dark-actions) would appear to be deliberate.\n\n### FF\n\nFast Futures function at Mattermost responsible for prototyping and validating enterprise customer needs ahead of product engineering investment, which was the approach applied to Calls, MS Teams and OpenOps prior to adding the functionality to the mainstream roadmap.  \n\n### GNN\n\nA status update format that is split into three categories: Going Well, Not Going Well, Next Actions. Read more about [GNNs here](../../operations/operations/company-cadence.md#gnn-updates).\n\n### Gross Margin (\u201cGM\u201d)-Weighted Magic Number\n\nA measurement to determine sales efficiency. The GM-Weighted Magic Number is determined by taking the Net Change in ARR for the Period (or New Logo & Expansion ARR in the period less Churn & Contraction) times the Gross Margin percentage, divided by total Sales & Marketing spend in the prior period. This metric attempts to quantify how much Sales & Marketing spend is required to generate ARR.\n\n### Gross Margin & Gross Margin %\n\nGross Margin is determined by taking Revenue less Cost of Goods Sold (\u201cCOGS\u201d or \u201cCOS\u201d). COGS or COS are the direct costs associated with delivering the product or service to existing customers (e.g. cost of Success, Support, hosting costs, etc.). Gross Margin % is calculated by taking Gross Margin and dividing by Revenue.\n\n### Gross Revenue Retention\n\nA measurement that attempts to quantify how well a company retains its existing customers. Gross Revenue Retention (\u201cGRR\u201d) is calculated by taking Beginning Balance ARR less Churn/Contraction and dividing by Beginning Balance ARR. Because both New Logo ARR and Expansion ARR are excluded from this calculation, this value cannot exceed 100%.\n\n### HW - Help Wanted\n\n[Help Wanted tickets](http://docs.mattermost.com/process/help-wanted.html), which are vetted changes to the source code open for community contributions.\n\n### Improvement\n\nA beneficial change to code that is not fixing a bug.\n\n### Iteration\n\nIteration means being able to quickly improve on something by shipping a minimally viable change in how we do things. It's the opposite of the \"wait, wait, wait, ship\" method we call the [Windows Vista Approach](list-of-terms.md#windows-vista-approach).\n\n### Latest\n\n\u201cLatest Release\u201d, a version of Mattermost which indicates the latest stable release.\n\n### LHS\n\nThe \u201cLeft-Hand Sidebar\u201d in the Mattermost team site, used for navigation.\n\n### Majority Regions\n\nCountries and regions outside the United States are referred to as \"majority regions\". We use this term for a few reasons, a\\) we use the word \"majority\" to remind everyone that the ~300M United States are only a tiny fraction \\(&lt;5%\\) of the world's 7 billion people \\(many American companies refer to the U.S. as \"domestic\" and the rest of the world as \"international\" which is counter to the inclusive culture at Mattermost\\), b\\) we use \"regions\" instead of \"countries\" because there are political issues with some locations.\n\nFor example, we should always refer to Taiwan as a \"region\" and not a \"country\" due to [geo-political issues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan#Political_and_legal_status).\n\n### Mana\n\nAn estimate of total energy, attention and effort required for a task - not a measure of amount of code to be changed or cumulative time needed for a change.\n\nA one-line change to code can cost more mana than a 100-line change due to risk and the need for documentation, testing, support, and all the other activities needed.\n\nEvery code change added has an initial and on-going mana cost in technical debt, test case coverages, and supportability, which is taken into account in feature decisions.\n\n### MBR\n\nThe \u201cMonthly Business Review\u201d, where senior leadership team and department heads work with functional leaders to clear escalations, make key decisions & have concrete next steps for the next review period.\n\n### MLT\n\nThe \u201cMattermost Leadership Team\u201d, senior leadership team and department heads working with the CEO in [MLT meetings and offsites](../../operations/operations/mlt-cadence/).\n\n### MME\n\nA customer that is any Midmarket (\"MM\") or Enterprise (\"E\") organization, including public sector, with 2,500 employees or more, buying a Mattermost subscription that's not on a non-profit or educational discount.\n\n### MOR\n\nMonthly Operating Review. A monthly review of operations from each department including a GNN and metrics.\n\n### MQL\n\nA Marketing Qualified Lead refers to a prospect deemed to have a higher likelihood of becoming a paying customer based on their marketing activities, e.g. certain website activities (content downloads, etc), trial activations, demo or quote requests, and more.\n\n### Net Dollar Retention\n\nA measurement that attempts to quantify the ability to both retain and grow our existing customers. Net Dollar Retention (\u201cNDR\u201d or Net Revenue Retention \u201cNRR\u201d) is calculated by taking Beginning Balance ARR + Expansion ARR - Churn/Contraction and dividing by Beginning Balance ARR. Because NDR includes the impact of Expansion ARR, this value can exceed 100%. NDR does not include the impact of New Logo ARR. This measurement is typically favored by investors.\n\nBoth GRR and NDR are typically presented on an annual basis, using a static Beginning Balance at the beginning of the year. For annual presentation, this number represents total Churn/Contraction for the year divided by the beginning balance of ARR at the start of the year. For mid-year discussion and presentation, this number represents total Churn/Contraction for the period (e.g. first half) divided by the beginning balance of ARR at the start of the year. It is important to note that annual churn will naturally present lower than mid-year churn, using this method, due to the fact that the numerator is changing but the denominator is not. \n\n### Nerfs and Buffs\n\nNerfs and buffs are the framework for setting culture at Mattermost.\n\nA \"nerf\" is a downgraded experience as the result of a behavior.\n\nFor example, if half of a team is traveling to a conference and holds a team meeting in a hotel room and the other half calls in remotely but they can't see everyone in the room and audio is low quality, then the team is \"nerfing\" their remote colleagues. The people in the hotel room are downgrading the experience of their remote colleagues.\n\nUnder this framework, we want to discourage behavior that nerfs remote work, so if your team is holding in-person meeting with remote colleagues, please split up to take the call from separate areas so everyone can be seen and heard.\n\nA \"buff\" is an upgrade experience as the result of a behavior. If a remote team is meeting on a topic with a clear, concise written proposal requesting asynchronous feedback, people who share high-quality feedback asynchronously ahead of the meeting may have an out-sized influence on iterations of the document ahead of the meeting, compared to people who don't provide asynchronous feedback ahead of the meeting.\n\nHere we want to buff asynchronous communication by focusing review on asynchronous comments ahead of live comments.\n\nCulture is the set of behaviors that are nerfed and buffed. As a remote-first culture, we want to buff behavior that promotes asynchronous communication and remote work. We want to nerf behavior that creates unnecessary synchronous meetings.\n\n### New Logo Sale\n\nA standard sale with a customer that has never previously purchased any kind of product or service from Mattermost, either directly or indirectly through a purchase by an affiliate on the customer\u2019s behalf. A sale shall be deemed to be a New Logo Sale even if one of customer's affiliates is already a customer of Mattermost so long as (a) the entity making the purchase has never itself previously made a purchase or has had a purchase made on its behalf, and (b) the new sale is either a purchase of a license key to a new Self-Hosted server independent from other Mattermost installs or a purchase of a subscription to a new Cloud workspace independent from other Mattermost workspaces. \n\n### Open Actions\n\nTerm for publicly documenting information in a web-discoverable format \\(GitHub Issue, Staff Handbook entry, forum post, etc.\\) prior to sharing guidance to staff and community members. We prefer open actions to [dark actions](list-of-terms.md#dark-actions).\n\n### PE\n\nProduct Engineering function at Mattermost responsible for the software architecture, design and development of the product focused on delivering high quality, reliably built and maintained features, systems and improvements applicable to the broad range of ideal customers.\n\n### PgM\n\nProgram Management function at Mattermost responsible for leading and executing key cross-functional programs, working with cross-departmental stakeholders to increase operational efficiency and accelerate alignment towards customer and company objectives.\n\n### PO\n\nProduct Operations function at Mattermost responsible for infrastructure engineering and customer reliability engineering. \n\n### PTO\n\n_Paid Time Off_ is time away from work paid for by the company to staff, including holidays, vacations, and approved leaves of absence. See [PTO](../../operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/paid-time-off/).\n\n### Renewal Success Rate\n\nA comparison of the actual dollar value renewed compared to the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal in the period. This measurement attempts to quantify the \u201csuccess rate\u201d of renewals scheduled in the period, and cannot exceed 100%. Unlike GRR or NDR, this measurement excludes the impact of any multi-year contracts that are not up for renewal in the period.\n\n### RHS\n\nThe \u201cRight-Hand Sidebar\u201d in the Mattermost team site, used for navigation.\n\n### SAL\n\nA Sales Accepted Lead refers to a prospect that a Sales team has spoken to either in-person (e.g. tradeshow, conference, dinner), or remotely (phone call, video call), and validated the prospect has a legitimate potential to convert to a paying customer.\n\n### SBIR\n\nA Small Business Innovation Research (or SBIR) program funded by the U.S. government to accelerate technology innovation in partnership with small businesses. Funding takes the form of contracts or grants. The recipient projects must have the potential for commercialization and must meet specific U.S. government R&D needs. \n\nThe program includes Phase 1 SBIRs (concepts with no development work), Phase 2 SBIRs (development work to create a prototype with a potential for commercialization), as well as larger contracts via TACFI, STRATFI and more: https://afwerx.com/divisions/afventures/stratfi-tacfi/\n\n### Spinmint\n\nSpinmint refers to our first generation of automated infrastructure to spin up test servers to evaluate pull requests. The word \"spin\" comes from the original name of our company, \"Spinpunch, Inc.\" \\(before we became \\(\"Mattermost, Inc.\"\\) and the word \"mint\" as a short, unambiguous, easy-to-spell name referring to a [factory method pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern).\n\n### SpinWick\n\nNew test servers that use the cloud infrastructure and can be spun up on pull requests to test changes. The name is reference to first generation infrastructure, [spinmint](list-of-terms.md#spinmint), combined with an arbitrary reference to a movie that some people saw called \u201cJohn Wick\u201d.\n\n### SOM\n\nStandard Operating Metrics are metrics tracked monthly by each department as indicators for operating health and status.\n\n### TAM\n\nTechnical Account Management function at Mattermost responsible for retaining & expanding customer revenue, including technical adoption & bottlenecks, technical onboarding, issue coordination and escalation.\n\n### Tombstoned\n\nReplacing a webpage with a link to the new page created so that people using the original link can easily find the new page. [An example of tombstoned terms can be found at the bottom of this page](list-of-terms.md#tombstoned-terms).\n\n### YouTweetInFace\n\nA reference to the major social media platforms: YouTube \\(\u201cYou\u201d\\), Twitter \\(\u201cTweet\u201d\\), LinkedIn \\(\u201cIn\u201d\\), and Facebook \\(\u201cFace\u201d\\). The [YouTweetInFace channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/pre-tweet) is used to discuss social media posts before asking contributors and community to engage with the content. The name is a reminder that our tone and approach to social media needs to be thoughtful, memorable, and ideally bring a smile.\n\n### Windows Vista Approach\n\nInstead of working iteratively a \"Windows Vista approach\" attempts to ship significant changes in a complex one-time effort, which seems like a good idea at the time but ends up causing delays, wasted effort, and numerous avoidable errors.\n\nThis tempting, high risk approach is named after Microsoft\u2019s \u201cWindows Vista\u201d operating system, one of its most famous examples.\n\n## Tombstoned Terms\n\nThe following is a list of terms no longer used with links to their definitions or notes on their deprecation. Tombstoned Terms use H3 headings on this page to distinguish them from active terms, which are H2 in heading formatting.\n\n#### Tomb-stoned\n\nPreviously hyphenated, now not hyphenated, see [Tombstoned](list-of-terms.md#tombstoned).\n\n#### Vacation-ready\n\nA team and process that is ready for a key member to go on vacation, or spend time away from work.\n\n",

The decision maker should feel free to ignore the input. As another example: \"4/5, I think before archiving a channel a user should type in the name of the channel to make sure they really want to do it\" expresses high conviction and the decision maker may want to ask more questions to understand whether <a href=\"mindsets.md#emotion-assumption-and-priority\">emotion, assumption, or priority</a> is behind the feedback.</p>\n<h3>Best Practices</h3>\n<p>We try not to use the term \"best practice\" at Mattermost, as it's counter-cultural to our focus on <a href=\"list-of-terms.md#iteration\">iteration</a>, <a href=\"./#leadership-principles\">self-awareness</a>, and <a href=\"./#leadership-principles\">earn trust</a>.

On average, full time Mattermost developers each complete tickets adding up to approximately 28 mana per week. A \u201csmall\u201d item is 2 mana, a \u201cmedium\u201d is 4, a \u201clarge\u201d is 8, and any project bigger needs to be broken down into smaller tickets.</p>\n<h3>DRI</h3>\n<p><em>Directly Responsible Individual</em> means a human individual who is accountable for a given Area Of Responsibility. A DRI is a single person, not a group of people. If there is a shift schedule, define each shift as a separate AOR (e.g. Tier 2 Mobile Support Escalations Weekdays 8am to 5pm Palo Alto time). If you are unsure who is the DRI, make the AOR more specific until the DRI is clear.</p>\n<h3>Edge</h3>\n<p>\u201cEdge Release\u201d, a version of Mattermost which indicates the latest unstable release off of the main branch.</p>\n<h3>ESR</h3>\n<p>\u201cExtended Support Release\u201d, a version of Mattermost maintained for a longer period of time that will receive security fixes.</p>\n<h3>Expansion</h3>\n<p>When an existing customer increases the dollar value of their ARR, either by adding licenses, adding additional products and/or reducing the discount being applied.</p>\n<h3>Expert Mode</h3>\n<p>Expert Mode (also known as \"Crimson Force Field\") is when documentation or on-screen text is written for someone with considerable knowledge or expertise, instead of being designed for a new learner. In general, try to state things simply rather than speaking to just the \u201cexperts\u201d reading the text.</p>\n<p>If something is extremely difficult to understand, and yet still justified in the mind of the writer, we call it \u201cCrimson Force Field\u201d. This term is intended to evoke the emotional response of coming across something that is difficult to understand, so writers of Crimson Force Field material can empathize with the readers. Crimson Force Field is drawn from an esoteric episode of Star Trek and it is unlikely anyone but the originator of the term understands its complete meaning. Crimson Force Field is itself Crimson Force Field.</p>\n<h3>False Openness</h3>\n<p>Keeping non-sensitive information that would be helpful for staff and community to know out of public web search through the use of dark actions. Often false openness is unintentional, though after staff members are educated on the topic and empowered to use <a href=\"list-of-terms.md#open-actions\">open actions</a>, continued use of <a href=\"list-of-terms.md#dark-actions\">dark actions</a> would appear to be deliberate.</p>\n<h3>FF</h3>\n<p>Fast Futures function at Mattermost responsible for prototyping and validating enterprise customer needs ahead of product engineering investment, which was the approach applied to Calls, MS Teams and OpenOps prior to adding the functionality to the mainstream roadmap.  </p>\n<h3>GNN</h3>\n<p>A status update format that is split into three categories: Going Well, Not Going Well, Next Actions. Read more about <a href=\"../../operations/operations/company-cadence.md#gnn-updates\">GNNs here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Gross Margin (\u201cGM\u201d)-Weighted Magic Number</h3>\n<p>A measurement to determine sales efficiency. The GM-Weighted Magic Number is determined by taking the Net Change in ARR for the Period (or New Logo &amp; Expansion ARR in the period less Churn &amp; Contraction) times the Gross Margin percentage, divided by total Sales &amp; Marketing spend in the prior period. This metric attempts to quantify how much Sales &amp; Marketing spend is required to generate ARR.</p>\n<h3>Gross Margin &amp; Gross Margin %</h3>\n<p>Gross Margin is determined by taking Revenue less Cost of Goods Sold (\u201cCOGS\u201d or \u201cCOS\u201d). COGS or COS are the direct costs associated with delivering the product or service to existing customers (e.g. cost of Success, Support, hosting costs, etc.). Gross Margin % is calculated by taking Gross Margin and dividing by Revenue.</p>\n<h3>Gross Revenue Retention</h3>\n<p>A measurement that attempts to quantify how well a company retains its existing customers. Gross Revenue Retention (\u201cGRR\u201d) is calculated by taking Beginning Balance ARR less Churn/Contraction and dividing by Beginning Balance ARR. Because both New Logo ARR and Expansion ARR are excluded from this calculation, this value cannot exceed 100%.</p>\n<h3>HW - Help Wanted</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://docs.mattermost.com/process/help-wanted.html\">Help Wanted tickets</a>, which are vetted changes to the source code open for community contributions.</p>\n<h3>Improvement</h3>\n<p>A beneficial change to code that is not fixing a bug.</p>\n<h3>Iteration</h3>\n<p>Iteration means being able to quickly improve on something by shipping a minimally viable change in how we do things. It's the opposite of the \"wait, wait, wait, ship\" method we call the <a href=\"list-of-terms.md#windows-vista-approach\">Windows Vista Approach</a>.</p>\n<h3>Latest</h3>\n<p>\u201cLatest Release\u201d, a version of Mattermost which indicates the latest stable release.</p>\n<h3>LHS</h3>\n<p>The \u201cLeft-Hand Sidebar\u201d in the Mattermost team site, used for navigation.</p>\n<h3>Majority Regions</h3>\n<p>Countries and regions outside the United States are referred to as \"majority regions\". We use this term for a few reasons, a) we use the word \"majority\" to remind everyone that the ~300M United States are only a tiny fraction (&lt;5%) of the world's 7 billion people (many American companies refer to the U.S. as \"domestic\" and the rest of the world as \"international\" which is counter to the inclusive culture at Mattermost), b) we use \"regions\" instead of \"countries\" because there are political issues with some locations.</p>\n<p>For example, we should always refer to Taiwan as a \"region\" and not a \"country\" due to <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan#Political_and_legal_status\">geo-political issues</a>.</p>\n<h3>Mana</h3>\n<p>An estimate of total energy, attention and effort required for a task - not a measure of amount of code to be changed or cumulative time needed for a change.</p>\n<p>A one-line change to code can cost more mana than a 100-line change due to risk and the need for documentation, testing, support, and all the other activities needed.</p>\n<p>Every code change added has an initial and on-going mana cost in technical debt, test case coverages, and supportability, which is taken into account in feature decisions.</p>\n<h3>MBR</h3>\n<p>The \u201cMonthly Business Review\u201d, where senior leadership team and department heads work with functional leaders to clear escalations, make key decisions &amp; have concrete next steps for the next review period.</p>\n<h3>MLT</h3>\n<p>The \u201cMattermost Leadership Team\u201d, senior leadership team and department heads working with the CEO in <a href=\"../../operations/operations/mlt-cadence/\">MLT meetings and offsites</a>.</p>\n<h3>MME</h3>\n<p>A customer that is any Midmarket (\"MM\") or Enterprise (\"E\") organization, including public sector, with 2,500 employees or more, buying a Mattermost subscription that's not on a non-profit or educational discount.</p>\n<h3>MOR</h3>\n<p>Monthly Operating Review. A monthly review of operations from each department including a GNN and metrics.</p>\n<h3>MQL</h3>\n<p>A Marketing Qualified Lead refers to a prospect deemed to have a higher likelihood of becoming a paying customer based on their marketing activities, e.g. certain website activities (content downloads, etc), trial activations, demo or quote requests, and more.</p>\n<h3>Net Dollar Retention</h3>\n<p>A measurement that attempts to quantify the ability to both retain and grow our existing customers. Net Dollar Retention (\u201cNDR\u201d or Net Revenue Retention \u201cNRR\u201d) is calculated by taking Beginning Balance ARR + Expansion ARR - Churn/Contraction and dividing by Beginning Balance ARR. Because NDR includes the impact of Expansion ARR, this value can exceed 100%. NDR does not include the impact of New Logo ARR. This measurement is typically favored by investors.</p>\n<p>Both GRR and NDR are typically presented on an annual basis, using a static Beginning Balance at the beginning of the year. For annual presentation, this number represents total Churn/Contraction for the year divided by the beginning balance of ARR at the start of the year. For mid-year discussion and presentation, this number represents total Churn/Contraction for the period (e.g. first half) divided by the beginning balance of ARR at the start of the year. It is important to note that annual churn will naturally present lower than mid-year churn, using this method, due to the fact that the numerator is changing but the denominator is not. </p>\n<h3>Nerfs and Buffs</h3>\n<p>Nerfs and buffs are the framework for setting culture at Mattermost.</p>\n<p>A \"nerf\" is a downgraded experience as the result of a behavior.</p>\n<p>For example, if half of a team is traveling to a conference and holds a team meeting in a hotel room and the other half calls in remotely but they can't see everyone in the room and audio is low quality, then the team is \"nerfing\" their remote colleagues. The people in the hotel room are downgrading the experience of their remote colleagues.</p>\n<p>Under this framework, we want to discourage behavior that nerfs remote work, so if your team is holding in-person meeting with remote colleagues, please split up to take the call from separate areas so everyone can be seen and heard.</p>\n<p>A \"buff\" is an upgrade experience as the result of a behavior. If a remote team is meeting on a topic with a clear, concise written proposal requesting asynchronous feedback, people who share high-quality feedback asynchronously ahead of the meeting may have an out-sized influence on iterations of the document ahead of the meeting, compared to people who don't provide asynchronous feedback ahead of the meeting.</p>\n<p>Here we want to buff asynchronous communication by focusing review on asynchronous comments ahead of live comments.</p>\n<p>Culture is the set of behaviors that are nerfed and buffed. As a remote-first culture, we want to buff behavior that promotes asynchronous communication and remote work. We want to nerf behavior that creates unnecessary synchronous meetings.</p>\n<h3>New Logo Sale</h3>\n<p>A standard sale with a customer that has never previously purchased any kind of product or service from Mattermost, either directly or indirectly through a purchase by an affiliate on the customer\u2019s behalf. A sale shall be deemed to be a New Logo Sale even if one of customer's affiliates is already a customer of Mattermost so long as (a) the entity making the purchase has never itself previously made a purchase or has had a purchase made on its behalf, and (b) the new sale is either a purchase of a license key to a new Self-Hosted server independent from other Mattermost installs or a purchase of a subscription to a new Cloud workspace independent from other Mattermost workspaces. </p>\n<h3>Open Actions</h3>\n<p>Term for publicly documenting information in a web-discoverable format (GitHub Issue, Staff Handbook entry, forum post, etc.) prior to sharing guidance to staff and community members. We prefer open actions to <a href=\"list-of-terms.md#dark-actions\">dark actions</a>.</p>\n<h3>PE</h3>\n<p>Product Engineering function at Mattermost responsible for the software architecture, design and development of the product focused on delivering high quality, reliably built and maintained features, systems and improvements applicable to the broad range of ideal customers.</p>\n<h3>PgM</h3>\n<p>Program Management function at Mattermost responsible for leading and executing key cross-functional programs, working with cross-departmental stakeholders to increase operational efficiency and accelerate alignment towards customer and company objectives.</p>\n<h3>PO</h3>\n<p>Product Operations function at Mattermost responsible for infrastructure engineering and customer reliability engineering. </p>\n<h3>PTO</h3>\n<p><em>Paid Time Off</em> is time away from work paid for by the company to staff, including holidays, vacations, and approved leaves of absence. See <a href=\"../../operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/paid-time-off/\">PTO</a>.</p>\n<h3>Renewal Success Rate</h3>\n<p>A comparison of the actual dollar value renewed compared to the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal in the period. This measurement attempts to quantify the \u201csuccess rate\u201d of renewals scheduled in the period, and cannot exceed 100%. Unlike GRR or NDR, this measurement excludes the impact of any multi-year contracts that are not up for renewal in the period.</p>\n<h3>RHS</h3>\n<p>The \u201cRight-Hand Sidebar\u201d in the Mattermost team site, used for navigation.</p>\n<h3>SAL</h3>\n<p>A Sales Accepted Lead refers to a prospect that a Sales team has spoken to either in-person (e.g. tradeshow, conference, dinner), or remotely (phone call, video call), and validated the prospect has a legitimate potential to convert to a paying customer.</p>\n<h3>SBIR</h3>\n<p>A Small Business Innovation Research (or SBIR) program funded by the U.S. government to accelerate technology innovation in partnership with small businesses. Funding takes the form of contracts or grants. The recipient projects must have the potential for commercialization and must meet specific U.S. government R&amp;D needs. </p>\n<p>The program includes Phase 1 SBIRs (concepts with no development work), Phase 2 SBIRs (development work to create a prototype with a potential for commercialization), as well as larger contracts via TACFI, STRATFI and more: https://afwerx.com/divisions/afventures/stratfi-tacfi/</p>\n<h3>Spinmint</h3>\n<p>Spinmint refers to our first generation of automated infrastructure to spin up test servers to evaluate pull requests. The word \"spin\" comes from the original name of our company, \"Spinpunch, Inc.\" (before we became (\"Mattermost, Inc.\") and the word \"mint\" as a short, unambiguous, easy-to-spell name referring to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern\">factory method pattern</a>.</p>\n<h3>SpinWick</h3>\n<p>New test servers that use the cloud infrastructure and can be spun up on pull requests to test changes. The name is reference to first generation infrastructure, <a href=\"list-of-terms.md#spinmint\">spinmint</a>, combined with an arbitrary reference to a movie that some people saw called \u201cJohn Wick\u201d.</p>\n<h3>SOM</h3>\n<p>Standard Operating Metrics are metrics tracked monthly by each department as indicators for operating health and status.</p>\n<h3>TAM</h3>\n<p>Technical Account Management function at Mattermost responsible for retaining &amp; expanding customer revenue, including technical adoption &amp; bottlenecks, technical onboarding, issue coordination and escalation.</p>\n<h3>Tombstoned</h3>\n<p>Replacing a webpage with a link to the new page created so that people using the original link can easily find the new page. <a href=\"list-of-terms.md#tombstoned-terms\">An example of tombstoned terms can be found at the bottom of this page</a>.</p>\n<h3>YouTweetInFace</h3>\n<p>A reference to the major social media platforms: YouTube (\u201cYou\u201d), Twitter (\u201cTweet\u201d), LinkedIn (\u201cIn\u201d), and Facebook (\u201cFace\u201d). The <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/pre-tweet\">YouTweetInFace channel</a> is used to discuss social media posts before asking contributors and community to engage with the content. The name is a reminder that our tone and approach to social media needs to be thoughtful, memorable, and ideally bring a smile.</p>\n<h3>Windows Vista Approach</h3>\n<p>Instead of working iteratively a \"Windows Vista approach\" attempts to ship significant changes in a complex one-time effort, which seems like a good idea at the time but ends up causing delays, wasted effort, and numerous avoidable errors.</p>\n<p>This tempting, high risk approach is named after Microsoft\u2019s \u201cWindows Vista\u201d operating system, one of its most famous examples.</p>\n<h2>Tombstoned Terms</h2>\n<p>The following is a list of terms no longer used with links to their definitions or notes on their deprecation.

        "title": "Vision",
        "content": "# Vision \n\nOur vision is becoming the leading solution for developer collaboration through an integrated suite of open core tools that accelerate developer productivity, increase software service levels, and raise workplace satisfaction among technical teams.\n\nAs the world moves more digital and remote, technical organizations face mounting challenges: stagnating productivity, increasing exposure to outages and service-level degradations, and declining workplace satisfaction leading to staffing churn and expanding talent gaps.\n\nWe solve these issues for customers by developing and delivering an open, flexible, developer-focused collaboration suite competing against both point solutions (Slack, Asana/Trello/Notion, WebEx/Zoom/Loom, RunDeck/Transposit/Firehydrant, Confluence/GitHuge Pages) and general-purpose collaboration suites (Microsoft Teams/Office, G Suite).\n\nWe deliver our solutions through an open core, product-led growth motion with freemium offerings that flow into usage and conversion from free-to-paid supported by Mattermost champions in customer accounts, frictionless self-serve purchase experience on both cloud and self-hosted instances, and both direct fulfillment and channel-based fulfillment depending on customer preferences and our ability to provide regional support. This motion is accelerated through our BDR and field sales motions with warm outbound into our freemium install base, plus cold outbound into named enterprise accounts driving awareness of the ROI of Mattermost solutions from like customers.\n\n# Market \n\nAnalysts project that in 2022, over $4.5 trillion USD will be spent on IT. What portion of that investment turns into productivity and results depends entirely on how well teams of software builders and operators can effectively collaborate.\n\nMattermost competes in a $15B market for \"developer collaboration\", a segment of the broader general collaboration market focused on accelerating developer productivity through agile workflows across application development, digital operations and security operations. Our focus is serving a market of 30 million developers with an integrated, open core collaboration suite across workplace messaging, project management, incident management, real time communication, and documentation available both in cloud and as a self-hosted component of an organization's digital infrastructure.\n\nMany of these organizations are facing three critical challenges:\n\n**Flat or declining developer productivity in post-remote environments.** While many technical organizations accelerated productivity in the initial move to remote work--decreasing commute time, onsite logistics, and interruptions--many post-remote environments now suffer from gaps in clarity and alignment that in-office environments provided in the past. The context created by in-person meetings, hallway conversations, war rooms--and even by physical whiteboards and post-it notes--continues to degrade in many organizations. Digital substitutes across meeting organization, note taking, workplace messaging, incident response, and project management have exploded as point solutions. They served as life rafts during the pandemic, but the misfit of teams, tools and workflows is now becoming an overwhelming tax--copy and pasting, inconsistent formatting, unclear access controls, redundancy of information, and the breakage of flow.\n\n**Increasing complexity, vendor lock-in and outage exposure.** In many organizations the acceleration to cloud has dramatically increased vendor-dependency, data lock-in, and exposure to the business disruption. In some cases, there is risk of both a company\u2019s technical infrastructure and online collaboration tools going down at the same time when they are outsourced to the same vendor, or share dependencies--especially cloud dependencies. These risks may be dramatically heightened with remote work if incident response teams don\u2019t have either a secure physical location to work on mitigations, or online collaboration tools independent of the underlying outage. Moreover, as cloud vendors control more and more of their customer\u2019s data and operations, businesses have fewer options to hold vendors accountable. \n\n**Gaps in workplace satisfaction for technical talent.** Acceleration in remote hiring coupled with a surge in global demand has made staffing developer organizations an unprecedented challenge. Workplace satisfaction is now more important than ever as a leading indicator of organizational success. Satisfaction includes both conceptual factors, such as opportunities for impact, connection and growth, and concrete factors such as the technologies and tools teams get to operate. Winning on workplace satisfaction in conceptual and concrete factors is a leading indicator of meeting the capacity needs of digital operations organizations, which is a leading factor to market relevance.\n\n# Business model\n\nMattermost uses a buyer-based open core business model to deliver a high trust, self-managed messaging platform for developers and high security end users. We develop a portfolio of offerings at different price points \\(including free/open source\\) that align to the needs and budgets of different buyers.\n\n## Mattermost Free / open source\n\nThe free/open source version of Mattermost is built for **developers** as an innovative, flexible, high trust collaboration platform that accelerates the productivity and agile workflows of a tight-knit team, and includes the following capabilities: \n\n### Channels \n\n(Workplace Messaging) - An open source alternative to Slack, with [Slack-compatible keyboard shortcuts](https://docs.mattermost.com/channels/keyboard-shortcuts-for-channels.html) and [Slack-compatible webhooks](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/webhooks-incoming.html#slack-compatibility), along with a layered extensibility model ranging from [plug-ins to custom applications](https://mattermost.com/integrations-overview/). \n\n### Boards \n\n(Work Management) - An open source alternative to Trello, Notion, Asana, Jira and Todoist, deeply integrated with Channels, with the ability to [import from other systems](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/boards.html), to [use and create custom templates and workflows](https://docs.mattermost.com/boards/templates.html), and to integrate deeply with the rest of the Mattermost collaboration platform. \n\n### Playbooks\n\n(Incident Management) - An open source alternative to Rundeck, Firehydrant, Transposit, and other incident management solutions for [standardizing](https://docs.mattermost.com/playbooks/setting-up-playbooks.html) and [running incident management escalations](https://docs.mattermost.com/playbooks/running-playbooks.html), remediations, and [timeline-based retrospectives](https://docs.mattermost.com/playbooks/refining-and-improving.html) deeply integrated with [access controls](https://docs.mattermost.com/playbooks/playbook-permissions.html) and real-time workplace messaging and [notification experiences](https://docs.mattermost.com/playbooks/notifications-and-updates.html) on the Mattermost platform.\n\nFor our self-hosting community, we have an open source **Mattermost Team Edition** available as a Linux Binary under MIT license that [deploys](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/deployment.html#upgrade-mattermost) with MySQL or PostgreSQL and optionally a web-proxy such as NGNIX. There's a single-node local machine \"Preview\" mode you can use to try out the features using Docker, along with a streamlined omnibus version you can use to get a production system up and running quickly on an Ubuntu-compatible Linux distribution. \n\nFor our cloud community, our \"Free\" offering is currently a hosted version of the open source Mattermost Team Edition available on demand from Mattermost.com with unlimited users and a flat rate hosting cost of $149/year. While the software is free, we currently do need to pay for hosting costs in this cloud offering, however we also have plans to provide a fully free offering in future subsidized by revenues from paid versions of Mattermost through our open core model. \n\n## Mattermost Professional \n\nOur entry-level paid version, Mattermost Professional, is built for **team managers** - commonly managers of managers - who need additional controls and workflows specific to multi-team coordination. This version can be purchased via self-service, through resellers, or - for accounts over a certain size in certain territories - transacted through our sales team.\n\n## Mattermost Enterprise \n\nAs usage of Mattermost grows, we have a high scale edition, Mattermost Enterprise, providing enterprise compliance features and high scale support, including self-managed, multi-node, high availability configurations.\n\n# Customer journey \n\nOur customer journey starts developers and IT admins seeking better collaboration tools for themselves and their teams. They may have used Mattermost personally, or in a previous role, or heard about the product through word of mouth, review sites, or discovered Mattermost through web search.\n\nThey discover, download, and install Mattermost using a [deployment guide](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/deployment.html). Over time, as the number of users grows beyond a single team, typically an IT administrator will be interested in the user management and access control features in Mattermost Professional, and be interested in getting a 30-day trial version license key to [upgrade to Mattermost E0 and activate the trial key](https://docs.mattermost.com/install/enterprise-install-upgrade.html?highlight=trial%20key). \n\nA subscription license to [Mattermost Professional](https://mattermost.com/pricing/) can be purchased online through our self-serve process, through a channel partner, or by [contacting a member of the Mattermost sales team](https://mattermost.com/contact-sales/) assigned to the territory. \n\nAs the deployment of Mattermost grows within an organization, typically past 250 or 500 users, the customer's procurement organization may be interested in advanced features and customization available in our [Mattermost Enterprise](https://mattermost.com/pricing/) offering.\n\n# Self-served motions\n\nFor Mattermost Professional, we have self-serve options to purchasing subscription licenses by credit card.\n\n# Sales-served motions\n\nWe're focused on a number of sales motions to turn leads and prospects into customers.\n\n### Champion-led inbound direct\n\nProspect comes to us to buy. In this motion, developers or a System Admin deploys the open source or cloud free version of Mattermost, adopts its usage, and realizes value for a small group (~20 for cloud and 5-25 for self-hosted). When they want to scale usage beyond 25 and need administrative features like user management, SAML SSO, and the champion contacts IT and procurement to purchase. IT or procurement contacts Mattermost and is directed to the sales team to discuss a purchase, ask for volume discounting, answer security, compliance or technical questions, and/or negotiate MSA terms on their way to a purchase.\n\nIn the meeting, Mattermost AE probes to get a detailed understanding of the customer\u2019s situation and needs using a MEDPPICC framework, and works with the prospect\u2019s IT, procurement, champion, economic buyer and other stakeholders to help the customer envision their success with Mattermost, complete an initial purchase, and set up the account for success in the post-purchase journey.\n\nKey Input: This process often begins with a **Marketing Qualified Lead** (\"MQL\") of a certain type (pricing quotation or \"Contact Us\" request) indicating a \"hand held high\" level of interest in a purchase, and a work email which can be used to determine the organization from which the MQL originates and can be used to identify the correct member of the sales team to lead and execute on our process based on territory and industry assignments.\n\nThis process can also begin with a **Product Qualified Lead** (\"PQL\") which is a type of MQL (has work email and can be mapped to a sales person) that has an indication of product adoption and ideally trial activation. In-product trial requests are an example of PQLs that can be used as a starting point for sales to accelerate this motion.\n\n### Champion-led inbound channel\n\nSimilar to Champion-Led Inbound Direct journey except prospect buys through a channel partner rather than working with our sales team directly. In some cases we don\u2019t have MEDPPICC information nor relationships with the key stakeholders at the accounts, and need to build up that context in order to properly connect with the account.\n\nKey input: The inputs for this motion are the same as for \"Champion-Led Inbound Direct\" (above) with the exception that PQLs and MQLs may be shared by our sales team with a channel partner, who may have relationships (e.g. vendor agreement with a prospect) or capabilities (e.g. speaking languages that the Mattermost field doesn't) that we don't have.\n\n### Sales-led warm outbound\n\nIdentifying organizations where the free version of Mattermost is used, contacting people who didn\u2019t reach out to us, and selling our way to close a new customer. \n\nIn this journey, the Mattermost sales team, either BDR or AE depending on region and segment, identifies an account where someone seems to be running the open source version of Mattermost (through webchat, contact requests, E0 download data, cloud trials, enterprise trials, noticing \u201cMattermost\u201d skillsets in LinkedIn profiles, etc.), identifies potential contacts (using ZoomInfo, LeadIQ/LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Demandbase and other resources), and outbounds (via email, LinkedIn, and social media) to different personas in the target organization to eventually connect with Mattermost champions, and for the AE to share the vision, benefits, use cases, ROI, and case studies of our commercial offerings, along with technical pre-sales support, and guide the prospect into becoming a customer.\n\nKey input: The minimum input is a Marketing Qualified Lead (\"MQL\") with a work email (so organization can be identified and the right sales person assigned), indications of early interest in Mattermost (e.g. newsletter sign-up, unactivated trial request, etc.), and product usage in some form (after MQL identifies the organization, sales can review public information like LinkedIn bios, blog posts, social shares from company employees, open source contributions, etc.).\n\nIn an outbound motion the intent is to reach multiple people in an organization, not just the person taking an MQL-creating action, so that marketing and sales resources can be applied to accelerating early interest into envision and unlocking value into purchase and expansion decisions.\n\n### Sales-led cold outbound\n\nSelling into organizations that aren\u2019t known to be using Mattermost but who are similar to existing Mattermost customers and could potentially benefit from our offerings, and potentially showed early interest. \n\nThis starts with BDRs and AEs focusing on a list of organizations - \u201dNamed accounts\u201d - that aren\u2019t known to use Mattermost, but are similar to existing customers who benefit from Mattermost, finding and contacting the right people at the organization to share about the ROI and benefits of Mattermost solutions, getting meetings, and getting agreement to run a trial to prove that Mattermost would solve the issues the prospect is facing, running the trial with technical pre-sales support, and closing customers who can understand the vision for how Mattermost solves their urgent needs, with a proof of value in the trial to validate the purchase they are making.\n\nKey input: Cold outbound can be started with just a list of \"Named Accounts\" that we believe would have similar needs and buying patterns as existing Mattermost customers. Ideally there are also MQLs similar to \"Sales-Led Warm Outbound\" though without the requirement of free usage to start this process.\n\n### Channel-led outbound\n\nIn some countries/regions, channel partners may execute Sales-Led outbound motions in partnership with our sales teams. This motion can be particularly additive in countries/regions and organizations with languages and culture that can\u2019t yet be supported with our internal sales organization, or to reach the existing customer base of a channel partner who are likely to have similar needs to existing Mattermost customers and likely to buy (e.g. Carahsoft/FedResults).\n\nKey input: The key input for a channel partner is training, enablement and on-going support on how to idenitify and call on high potential existing customers to consider, evaluate and purchase Mattermost offerings.\n\nThis motion is not yet broadly used, as the majority of channel activity is currently from \"Champion-Led Inbound Channel\" (described above).\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n### What keeps other companies from using your open source software to create offerings that compete with your paid products?\n\nWe use the acronym \"TACTICAL\" to summarize the approach to maintaining differentiation of the paid version of our offerings to offerings a competitor may create from our open source code base:\n\n* **Test infrastructure:** We use [SaaS QA](https://www.rainforestqa.com/) which isn't included in the open source version.\n* **Alignment:** Developer features are free. Paid features are for managers and IT pros, who are less likely to spend time and effort forking and maintaining an open source project vs. deploying budgets to purchase paid features.\n* **Core committers:** We work with an active community of [core committers](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms#core-committers) to keep the project and business in sync.\n* **Threat intelligence:** Mattermost's [responsible disclosure policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report) means forks will lag in threat intelligence.\n* **Innovation:** Regular ship cycles and high velocity innovation rapidly lower the value of forks.\n* **Compatibility:** Only genuine versions upgrade smoothly to new releases and security patches.\n* **Architecture:** Modular architecture makes the need to fork rare.\n* **Licensing:** Mattermost's trademark is registered internationally, forking requires renaming.\n",
        "html": "<h1>Vision</h1>\n<p>Our vision is becoming the leading solution for developer collaboration through an integrated suite of open core tools that accelerate developer productivity, increase software service levels, and raise workplace satisfaction among technical teams.</p>\n<p>As the world moves more digital and remote, technical organizations face mounting challenges: stagnating productivity, increasing exposure to outages and service-level degradations, and declining workplace satisfaction leading to staffing churn and expanding talent gaps.</p>\n<p>We solve these issues for customers by developing and delivering an open, flexible, developer-focused collaboration suite competing against both point solutions (Slack, Asana/Trello/Notion, WebEx/Zoom/Loom, RunDeck/Transposit/Firehydrant, Confluence/GitHuge Pages) and general-purpose collaboration suites (Microsoft Teams/Office, G Suite).</p>\n<p>We deliver our solutions through an open core, product-led growth motion with freemium offerings that flow into usage and conversion from free-to-paid supported by Mattermost champions in customer accounts, frictionless self-serve purchase experience on both cloud and self-hosted instances, and both direct fulfillment and channel-based fulfillment depending on customer preferences and our ability to provide regional support. This motion is accelerated through our BDR and field sales motions with warm outbound into our freemium install base, plus cold outbound into named enterprise accounts driving awareness of the ROI of Mattermost solutions from like customers.</p>\n<h1>Market</h1>\n<p>Analysts project that in 2022, over $4.5 trillion USD will be spent on IT. What portion of that investment turns into productivity and results depends entirely on how well teams of software builders and operators can effectively collaborate.</p>\n<p>Mattermost competes in a $15B market for \"developer collaboration\", a segment of the broader general collaboration market focused on accelerating developer productivity through agile workflows across application development, digital operations and security operations. Our focus is serving a market of 30 million developers with an integrated, open core collaboration suite across workplace messaging, project management, incident management, real time communication, and documentation available both in cloud and as a self-hosted component of an organization's digital infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Many of these organizations are facing three critical challenges:</p>\n<p><strong>Flat or declining developer productivity in post-remote environments.</strong> While many technical organizations accelerated productivity in the initial move to remote work--decreasing commute time, onsite logistics, and interruptions--many post-remote environments now suffer from gaps in clarity and alignment that in-office environments provided in the past. The context created by in-person meetings, hallway conversations, war rooms--and even by physical whiteboards and post-it notes--continues to degrade in many organizations. Digital substitutes across meeting organization, note taking, workplace messaging, incident response, and project management have exploded as point solutions. They served as life rafts during the pandemic, but the misfit of teams, tools and workflows is now becoming an overwhelming tax--copy and pasting, inconsistent formatting, unclear access controls, redundancy of information, and the breakage of flow.</p>\n<p><strong>Increasing complexity, vendor lock-in and outage exposure.</strong> In many organizations the acceleration to cloud has dramatically increased vendor-dependency, data lock-in, and exposure to the business disruption. In some cases, there is risk of both a company\u2019s technical infrastructure and online collaboration tools going down at the same time when they are outsourced to the same vendor, or share dependencies--especially cloud dependencies. These risks may be dramatically heightened with remote work if incident response teams don\u2019t have either a secure physical location to work on mitigations, or online collaboration tools independent of the underlying outage. Moreover, as cloud vendors control more and more of their customer\u2019s data and operations, businesses have fewer options to hold vendors accountable. </p>\n<p><strong>Gaps in workplace satisfaction for technical talent.</strong> Acceleration in remote hiring coupled with a surge in global demand has made staffing developer organizations an unprecedented challenge. Workplace satisfaction is now more important than ever as a leading indicator of organizational success. Satisfaction includes both conceptual factors, such as opportunities for impact, connection and growth, and concrete factors such as the technologies and tools teams get to operate. Winning on workplace satisfaction in conceptual and concrete factors is a leading indicator of meeting the capacity needs of digital operations organizations, which is a leading factor to market relevance.</p>\n<h1>Business model</h1>\n<p>Mattermost uses a buyer-based open core business model to deliver a high trust, self-managed messaging platform for developers and high security end users. We develop a portfolio of offerings at different price points (including free/open source) that align to the needs and budgets of different buyers.</p>\n<h2>Mattermost Free / open source</h2>\n<p>The free/open source version of Mattermost is built for <strong>developers</strong> as an innovative, flexible, high trust collaboration platform that accelerates the productivity and agile workflows of a tight-knit team, and includes the following capabilities: </p>\n<h3>Channels</h3>\n<p>(Workplace Messaging) - An open source alternative to Slack, with <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/channels/keyboard-shortcuts-for-channels.html\">Slack-compatible keyboard shortcuts</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/webhooks-incoming.html#slack-compatibility\">Slack-compatible webhooks</a>, along with a layered extensibility model ranging from <a href=\"https://mattermost.com/integrations-overview/\">plug-ins to custom applications</a>. </p>\n<h3>Boards</h3>\n<p>(Work Management) - An open source alternative to Trello, Notion, Asana, Jira and Todoist, deeply integrated with Channels, with the ability to <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/boards.html\">import from other systems</a>, to <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/boards/templates.html\">use and create custom templates and workflows</a>, and to integrate deeply with the rest of the Mattermost collaboration platform. </p>\n<h3>Playbooks</h3>\n<p>(Incident Management) - An open source alternative to Rundeck, Firehydrant, Transposit, and other incident management solutions for <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/playbooks/setting-up-playbooks.html\">standardizing</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/playbooks/running-playbooks.html\">running incident management escalations</a>, remediations, and <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/playbooks/refining-and-improving.html\">timeline-based retrospectives</a> deeply integrated with <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/playbooks/playbook-permissions.html\">access controls</a> and real-time workplace messaging and <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/playbooks/notifications-and-updates.html\">notification experiences</a> on the Mattermost platform.</p>\n<p>For our self-hosting community, we have an open source <strong>Mattermost Team Edition</strong> available as a Linux Binary under MIT license that <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/deployment.html#upgrade-mattermost\">deploys</a> with MySQL or PostgreSQL and optionally a web-proxy such as NGNIX. There's a single-node local machine \"Preview\" mode you can use to try out the features using Docker, along with a streamlined omnibus version you can use to get a production system up and running quickly on an Ubuntu-compatible Linux distribution. </p>\n<p>For our cloud community, our \"Free\" offering is currently a hosted version of the open source Mattermost Team Edition available on demand from Mattermost.com with unlimited users and a flat rate hosting cost of $149/year. While the software is free, we currently do need to pay for hosting costs in this cloud offering, however we also have plans to provide a fully free offering in future subsidized by revenues from paid versions of Mattermost through our open core model. </p>\n<h2>Mattermost Professional</h2>\n<p>Our entry-level paid version, Mattermost Professional, is built for <strong>team managers</strong> - commonly managers of managers - who need additional controls and workflows specific to multi-team coordination. This version can be purchased via self-service, through resellers, or - for accounts over a certain size in certain territories - transacted through our sales team.</p>\n<h2>Mattermost Enterprise</h2>\n<p>As usage of Mattermost grows, we have a high scale edition, Mattermost Enterprise, providing enterprise compliance features and high scale support, including self-managed, multi-node, high availability configurations.</p>\n<h1>Customer journey</h1>\n<p>Our customer journey starts developers and IT admins seeking better collaboration tools for themselves and their teams. They may have used Mattermost personally, or in a previous role, or heard about the product through word of mouth, review sites, or discovered Mattermost through web search.</p>\n<p>They discover, download, and install Mattermost using a <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/deployment.html\">deployment guide</a>. Over time, as the number of users grows beyond a single team, typically an IT administrator will be interested in the user management and access control features in Mattermost Professional, and be interested in getting a 30-day trial version license key to <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/install/enterprise-install-upgrade.html?highlight=trial%20key\">upgrade to Mattermost E0 and activate the trial key</a>. </p>\n<p>A subscription license to <a href=\"https://mattermost.com/pricing/\">Mattermost Professional</a> can be purchased online through our self-serve process, through a channel partner, or by <a href=\"https://mattermost.com/contact-sales/\">contacting a member of the Mattermost sales team</a> assigned to the territory. </p>\n<p>As the deployment of Mattermost grows within an organization, typically past 250 or 500 users, the customer's procurement organization may be interested in advanced features and customization available in our <a href=\"https://mattermost.com/pricing/\">Mattermost Enterprise</a> offering.</p>\n<h1>Self-served motions</h1>\n<p>For Mattermost Professional, we have self-serve options to purchasing subscription licenses by credit card.</p>\n<h1>Sales-served motions</h1>\n<p>We're focused on a number of sales motions to turn leads and prospects into customers.</p>\n<h3>Champion-led inbound direct</h3>\n<p>Prospect comes to us to buy. In this motion, developers or a System Admin deploys the open source or cloud free version of Mattermost, adopts its usage, and realizes value for a small group (~20 for cloud and 5-25 for self-hosted). When they want to scale usage beyond 25 and need administrative features like user management, SAML SSO, and the champion contacts IT and procurement to purchase. IT or procurement contacts Mattermost and is directed to the sales team to discuss a purchase, ask for volume discounting, answer security, compliance or technical questions, and/or negotiate MSA terms on their way to a purchase.</p>\n<p>In the meeting, Mattermost AE probes to get a detailed understanding of the customer\u2019s situation and needs using a MEDPPICC framework, and works with the prospect\u2019s IT, procurement, champion, economic buyer and other stakeholders to help the customer envision their success with Mattermost, complete an initial purchase, and set up the account for success in the post-purchase journey.</p>\n<p>Key Input: This process often begins with a <strong>Marketing Qualified Lead</strong> (\"MQL\") of a certain type (pricing quotation or \"Contact Us\" request) indicating a \"hand held high\" level of interest in a purchase, and a work email which can be used to determine the organization from which the MQL originates and can be used to identify the correct member of the sales team to lead and execute on our process based on territory and industry assignments.</p>\n<p>This process can also begin with a <strong>Product Qualified Lead</strong> (\"PQL\") which is a type of MQL (has work email and can be mapped to a sales person) that has an indication of product adoption and ideally trial activation. In-product trial requests are an example of PQLs that can be used as a starting point for sales to accelerate this motion.</p>\n<h3>Champion-led inbound channel</h3>\n<p>Similar to Champion-Led Inbound Direct journey except prospect buys through a channel partner rather than working with our sales team directly. In some cases we don\u2019t have MEDPPICC information nor relationships with the key stakeholders at the accounts, and need to build up that context in order to properly connect with the account.</p>\n<p>Key input: The inputs for this motion are the same as for \"Champion-Led Inbound Direct\" (above) with the exception that PQLs and MQLs may be shared by our sales team with a channel partner, who may have relationships (e.g. vendor agreement with a prospect) or capabilities (e.g. speaking languages that the Mattermost field doesn't) that we don't have.</p>\n<h3>Sales-led warm outbound</h3>\n<p>Identifying organizations where the free version of Mattermost is used, contacting people who didn\u2019t reach out to us, and selling our way to close a new customer. </p>\n<p>In this journey, the Mattermost sales team, either BDR or AE depending on region and segment, identifies an account where someone seems to be running the open source version of Mattermost (through webchat, contact requests, E0 download data, cloud trials, enterprise trials, noticing \u201cMattermost\u201d skillsets in LinkedIn profiles, etc.), identifies potential contacts (using ZoomInfo, LeadIQ/LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Demandbase and other resources), and outbounds (via email, LinkedIn, and social media) to different personas in the target organization to eventually connect with Mattermost champions, and for the AE to share the vision, benefits, use cases, ROI, and case studies of our commercial offerings, along with technical pre-sales support, and guide the prospect into becoming a customer.</p>\n<p>Key input: The minimum input is a Marketing Qualified Lead (\"MQL\") with a work email (so organization can be identified and the right sales person assigned), indications of early interest in Mattermost (e.g. newsletter sign-up, unactivated trial request, etc.), and product usage in some form (after MQL identifies the organization, sales can review public information like LinkedIn bios, blog posts, social shares from company employees, open source contributions, etc.).</p>\n<p>In an outbound motion the intent is to reach multiple people in an organization, not just the person taking an MQL-creating action, so that marketing and sales resources can be applied to accelerating early interest into envision and unlocking value into purchase and expansion decisions.</p>\n<h3>Sales-led cold outbound</h3>\n<p>Selling into organizations that aren\u2019t known to be using Mattermost but who are similar to existing Mattermost customers and could potentially benefit from our offerings, and potentially showed early interest. </p>\n<p>This starts with BDRs and AEs focusing on a list of organizations - \u201dNamed accounts\u201d - that aren\u2019t known to use Mattermost, but are similar to existing customers who benefit from Mattermost, finding and contacting the right people at the organization to share about the ROI and benefits of Mattermost solutions, getting meetings, and getting agreement to run a trial to prove that Mattermost would solve the issues the prospect is facing, running the trial with technical pre-sales support, and closing customers who can understand the vision for how Mattermost solves their urgent needs, with a proof of value in the trial to validate the purchase they are making.</p>\n<p>Key input: Cold outbound can be started with just a list of \"Named Accounts\" that we believe would have similar needs and buying patterns as existing Mattermost customers. Ideally there are also MQLs similar to \"Sales-Led Warm Outbound\" though without the requirement of free usage to start this process.</p>\n<h3>Channel-led outbound</h3>\n<p>In some countries/regions, channel partners may execute Sales-Led outbound motions in partnership with our sales teams. This motion can be particularly additive in countries/regions and organizations with languages and culture that can\u2019t yet be supported with our internal sales organization, or to reach the existing customer base of a channel partner who are likely to have similar needs to existing Mattermost customers and likely to buy (e.g. Carahsoft/FedResults).</p>\n<p>Key input: The key input for a channel partner is training, enablement and on-going support on how to idenitify and call on high potential existing customers to consider, evaluate and purchase Mattermost offerings.</p>\n<p>This motion is not yet broadly used, as the majority of channel activity is currently from \"Champion-Led Inbound Channel\" (described above).</p>\n<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>\n<h3>What keeps other companies from using your open source software to create offerings that compete with your paid products?</h3>\n<p>We use the acronym \"TACTICAL\" to summarize the approach to maintaining differentiation of the paid version of our offerings to offerings a competitor may create from our open source code base:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Test infrastructure:</strong> We use <a href=\"https://www.rainforestqa.com/\">SaaS QA</a> which isn't included in the open source version.</li>\n<li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Developer features are free.

We develop a small portion as proprietary technology, built upon our open source work, to license for subscription fees that enable more high quality open source work to be produced. Since the start of the Mattermost open source project in 2015, we have used this model to develop effective open source solutions for the world to use. This model is sometimes called [Thin Open Core](https://medium.com/open-consensus/2-open-core-definition-examples-tradeoffs-e4d0c044da7c).\n\n**Remote-first** means that the majority of our staff works from home, cottages, coffee shops and other personal areas, rather than at a shared corporate office location. Mattermost was born in an extraordinary age where remote-first organizations can attract, hire and enable remote teams to produce better technology, business process and business results in less time than office-based teams, while maintaining security and compliance standards.\n\nRemote-first culture flourishes when we share one simple principle: **Courtesy**. Courtesy means Mattermosters are thoughtful about keeping our communities appropriately informed, following etiquette for discussions, calls and video meetings, and giving and receiving feedback on how to work better together. Courtesy also means we gladly accommodate those who prefer to work out of a dedicated office. We are remote-first, not remote-only.\n\n**Communities-centered** means we define our success in the context of the success of our [communities](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/contributors/community): users, customers, implementers, resellers, technology partners, contributors, and colleagues. The success of each community is owned by a member of the Mattermost leadership team. The plural definition of \u201ccommunities\u201d is intended to avoid unconsciously marginalizing downstream stakeholders.\n\n**Based in Palo Alto, California and headquartered on the internet** means the mailing address for Mattermost, Inc. is in Palo Alto, California, and our headquarters is on the internet, specifically the production-quality Mattermost instance at [https://community.mattermost.com](https://community.mattermost.com/). Our online headquarters is where Mattermost staff work with our communities of colleagues, users, partners, customers, candidates, contributors, and other [community members](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/community-overview.html) to envision, develop, and refine new open source technologies to make the world safer and more productive.\n\n## Logo\n\n|  |  |  |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| The Mattermost logomark is called \"the instrument\".

We develop a small portion as proprietary technology, built upon our open source work, to license for subscription fees that enable more high quality open source work to be produced. Since the start of the Mattermost open source project in 2015, we have used this model to develop effective open source solutions for the world to use. This model is sometimes called <a href=\"https://medium.com/open-consensus/2-open-core-definition-examples-tradeoffs-e4d0c044da7c\">Thin Open Core</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Remote-first</strong> means that the majority of our staff works from home, cottages, coffee shops and other personal areas, rather than at a shared corporate office location. Mattermost was born in an extraordinary age where remote-first organizations can attract, hire and enable remote teams to produce better technology, business process and business results in less time than office-based teams, while maintaining security and compliance standards.</p>\n<p>Remote-first culture flourishes when we share one simple principle: <strong>Courtesy</strong>. Courtesy means Mattermosters are thoughtful about keeping our communities appropriately informed, following etiquette for discussions, calls and video meetings, and giving and receiving feedback on how to work better together. Courtesy also means we gladly accommodate those who prefer to work out of a dedicated office. We are remote-first, not remote-only.</p>\n<p><strong>Communities-centered</strong> means we define our success in the context of the success of our <a href=\"https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/contributors/community\">communities</a>: users, customers, implementers, resellers, technology partners, contributors, and colleagues. The success of each community is owned by a member of the Mattermost leadership team. The plural definition of \u201ccommunities\u201d is intended to avoid unconsciously marginalizing downstream stakeholders.</p>\n<p><strong>Based in Palo Alto, California and headquartered on the internet</strong> means the mailing address for Mattermost, Inc. is in Palo Alto, California, and our headquarters is on the internet, specifically the production-quality Mattermost instance at <a href=\"https://community.mattermost.com/\">https://community.mattermost.com</a>. Our online headquarters is where Mattermost staff work with our communities of colleagues, users, partners, customers, candidates, contributors, and other <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/process/community-overview.html\">community members</a> to envision, develop, and refine new open source technologies to make the world safer and more productive.</p>\n<h2>Logo</h2>\n<p>|  |  |  |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| The Mattermost logomark is called \"the instrument\".

        "content": "# Mindsets\n\nMindsets are \u201ctool sets for the mind\u201d that help us find blindspots and increase performance in specific situations. They\u2019re a reflection of our shared learnings and culture in the Mattermost community and at Mattermost Inc.\n\nTo make the most out of mindsets, remember:\n\n* **Mindsets are tools:** Use common sense to find the right mindset for your situation. Avoid using ones that don\u2019t fit.\n* **Mindsets are temporary:** Try on a mindset the way you\u2019d try a tool. You can always put it down if it doesn\u2019t work.\n* **Mindsets are not laws:** Mindsets are situation-specific, not universal. Don\u2019t use them to debate.\n\nWhen you read about great leaders, they share mindsets relevant to success in their specific situations, which differ from their peers. Remember that \u201cadvice is personal experience generalized\u201d so be mindful about what you apply.\n\nIn this context, here are mindsets for Mattermost:\n\n## Learn, Master, Teach\n\n**Learn** a new topic quickly, develop **mastery** \\(be the smartest person at the team/company/community on the topic\\), then **teach** it to someone who will start the cycle over.\n\nThe best teachers can speed colleagues to surpass them. This mindset helps us constantly grow and rotate into new roles, while preventing single-points of failure where only one person is qualified for a certain task.\n\n## Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast\n\nRushing to get something done can create confusion, errors, and/or \\(paradoxically\\) delays.\n\nWhen you feel rushed, consider slowing down and taking a moment to ask: What would it look like for this project to be running smoothly?\n\nIf you're running a collaborative project, consider:\n\n1. Are the people I'm working with clear on the intent of this project or workflow?\n2. Is everyone clear on who needs to do what?\n3. Are we aligned on the measures that signal if our work is a success?\n\nGetting to a \"Yes\" on these three questions can smooth out your process, and move things faster.\n\n## Boring Solutions\n\nUse the simplest and most boring solution to solve problems.\n\nThe speed of innovation for our organization and product is constrained by the total complexity we have added so far, so every little reduction in complexity helps. Don\u2019t pick an interesting technology or methodology just to make your work more fun; using established and proven tech and processes that best match our needs to ensure a more stable and more familiar experience for you and other contributors.\n\nWhen facing a high impact problem without a simple and obvious solution, focus your time on:\n\n* Understanding the problem you're solving.\n* Understanding how others have solved the same problem in an enduring way.\n* What vital changes, if any, are needed to apply a proven solution that works.\n\n**More:** Read GitLab's boring solutions mindset and Dan McKinley's blog post on [choosing boring technology](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology).\n\n## Emotion, Assumption, and Priority\n\nConsider when rational people disagree, the cause often comes from one of three areas: emotion, assumption, and priority. Understanding the underlying difference in thinking can help us get to agreement faster:\n\n1. **Emotion:** Is there a strong emotion biasing the discussion? Talking through that emotion can often solve an issue. It\u2019s okay to have emotions. We're humans, not robots.\n2. **Assumption:** People may have different underlying **assumptions** \\(including definitions\\). Try to understand each other\u2019s assumptions and get to agreement or facts when you can.\n3. **Priorities:** Finally, people can have different **priorities**. When everyone\u2019s priorities are shared and understood it\u2019s easier to find solutions that satisfy everyone\u2019s criteria.\n\nWhile the emotions, assumptions, priority mindset won\u2019t work for everyone in every case, it\u2019s helped resolve complex decisions in our company\u2019s history.\n\n## Likes and Wishes\n\nAn easy way to check in with team members about how things are going.\n\n* What do you _like_ about how things are going?\n* What do you _wish_ we might change?\n\nUse these one-on-one or in a group as a way to open conversations about what to keep and what to change in how we do things.\n\n## Drafts at 1%, 50%, 99%\n\nBeing clear on expectations when asking for someone\u2019s review can help speed and smooth the process. In this mindset, there are three types of review:\n\n* **1% Draft:** Completely open to ideas and changes in direction. Rework is inexpensive.\n* **50% Draft:** Half complete work. There is structure, but also a lot of room for change. Some rework is inexpensive, some is expensive.\n* **99% Draft:** Nearly completed work. Rework at this point is very expensive.\n\n## Shoulder Check\n\nWhen a new owner takes over a process or a project from a previous owner, there are a finite number of \u201cblindspots\u201d of which the original owner is aware and the new owner will need to understand.\n\nUsing the analogy of changing lanes while driving a vehicle and learning to do a \u201cshoulder check\u201d for information that is not visible from standard controls, we have a process for the new owner and previous owner to jointly review processes until the transfer is complete.\n\nThis process is similar to [Mini-boss, End-boss](#mini-boss-end-boss), except that the mini-boss is also the new owner of a process, and not only a reviewer. Shoulder checks should be requested by new owners to avoid \u201ccrashing\u201d:\n\n* Making changes to systems that break existing processes may lose data and hurt the productivity of others downstream without notice and without a replacement system in place \\(behavior known as [\u201cDead Tarzan\u201d](#dead-tarzan)\\).\n* Repeatedly investing in mis-prioritized projects due to a misunderstanding of requirements from project stakeholders and insufficient confirmation of intended outcomes.\n\nEven when not crashing, as part of our [Self Awareness leadership principle](../../company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles.md), top team members will constantly be seeking feedback and review from people around the company.\n\n## Brown M&Ms\n\nA \u201cbrown M&M\u201d is a mistake that could either signal dangerous oversights in the execution of a project, or be a completely innocuous and unimportant error. When a brown M&M is found, aim to rule out a dangerous error as quickly as possible. Do fast drilldowns and systematic checks to see if more brown M&Ms are found, and if so, an entire project may need to be reviewed.\n\nExamples of brown M&Ms may include:\n\n* Significant mistakes in process, consistency or documentation suggesting lack of review or lack of understanding of the pre-existing system.\n* Ambiguous definitions that would make completion of a procedure difficult or unpredictable.\n\nThe name \"brown M&M\" comes from a safety technique used by the American music band Van Halen, who had to set up large, complex concert stages in third tier cities, where few local workers had experience with the safety standards vital to construction. In the [contract rider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Halen#Contract_riders) with each venue, Van Halen required a bowl of M&M candies with all brown M&Ms removed. Failure to provide the bowl was grounds for Van Halen\u2019s stage crew to inspect all of the local vendor\u2019s work for safety issues, because it meant the vendor had not paid attention to detail, and safety could be at risk.\n\n## Correct Minimums: Medic, Field Surgeon, Plastic Surgeon\n\nWhen making project investment decisions, we optimize for high impact in the context of customer obsession, empowered by ownership, while being constrained by \u201cbe proud of what you build\u201d.\n\nThe failure case is over-investing in processes and infrastructure, stealing mana from higher priority work, reducing speed and agility for the company and unnecessarily increasing cost and bureaucracy.\n\nThe objective of optimization is to invest at minimal levels for efficiency and safety while maximizing impact.\n\nIn making these trade-offs, consider the following mindsets:\n\n* **Correct Minimum 1: Medic**\n\n  > Safely fix something that is important, broken, and dangerous as fast as possible. Speed is critical - don't worry about \u201cleaving a scar\u201d on our architecture or business process, just own it and get it done. Solve the problem, **do not overbuild**.\n  >\n  > _Example:_ Something incorrect on our public website with more than 100 page views a month should be fixed immediately and not delayed to be done with a longer-term project, such as a website redesign. If the staging server cannot be pushed, this means manually fixing production and duplicating that change on staging, rather than trying to fix staging.\n\n* **Correct Minimum 2: Field Surgeon**\n\n  > Triage tasks that are important and broken but not dangerous, and fix the most important things with a minimum time and cost. Scarring should be a low-priority consideration \u2013 it's fine to leave scars and it's fine to spend a little energy to avoid big ones. Solve the problem for the next stage of growth, but don\u2019t solve it in two to three stages ahead.\n  >\n  > _Example:_ In Mattermost, spend 2 mana to enable automated messages over 4000 characters to be broken into multiple posts instead of being rejected, which is a problem every developer hits when they attempt to output log information via `curl` commands.\n\n* **Correct Minimum 3: Plastic Surgeon**\n\n  > Fix and optimize critical, high volume flows in our customer experience and product with heavy investment if needed to make high impact changes. Scars can be avoided and removed to produce a high impact result.\n  >\n  > _Example:_ Click-tracking traffic on about.mattermost.com and optimizing flows to direct visitors to learn about the product and downloading it is a flow that should be continually optimized.\n\n## Mini-boss, End-boss\n\nAfter completing the initial draft of a project, there may often be more than one reviewer to approve changes. This may be for different disciplines to review the work \\(for example, both development and design teams reviewing code changes to the user experience\\) and it may also be for reviewers with different levels of experience to share feedback.\n\nWhen reviewing significant user interface changes, code changes, responses to community or customers, or changes to systems or marketing material changes, it is ideal to have at least two reviewers:\n\n* **Mini-boss:** Reviewer less experienced in domain or Mattermost standards for the first review.\n* **End-boss:** Reviewer more experienced in domain or Mattermost standards for the final review for the discipline \\(e.g. development, design, documentation, etc.\\).\n\nThis system has several benefits:\n\n1. The Mini-boss provides feedback on the most obvious issues, allowing the End-boss to focus on nuanced issues the Mini-boss didn\u2019t find.\n2. The Mini-boss learns from the End-boss feedback, understanding what was missed, and becoming a better reviewer.\n3. Eventually the Mini-boss will be as skilled at reviewing as the End-boss, who will have nothing further to add after the Mini-boss review. At this point, the Mini-boss becomes an End-boss, ready to train a new Mini-boss.\n\nThe naming of this term comes from video games, where a person submitting material for review must pass a \u201cmini-boss\u201d challenge before a \u201cend-boss\u201d challenge for different disciplines.\n\n## Savor Surprises\n\nWhen we make important decisions quickly it's important to run at least a lightweight analysis to identify blindspots that could put success at risk. \"Savoring surprises\" means discussing unexpected findings from an analysis and understanding root cause in order to de-risk our original plan and/or find new opportunities.\n\nExample: In our early days, just months after launching our first commercial product Mattermost had a product roadmap for security and DevOps features that was vetted by customer roadmap reviews. We \"savored the surprise\" that custom emojis \\(which we assumed was a vanity feature to be cut\\) was highly important to support legacy processes that used them to communicate different outcomes of an automated process, like a build break. The surprise made our roadmap more valuable and effective.\n\nA good analysis will result in surprises uncovering blindspots. An analysis that has no surprises is a surprise in itself and the blindspot should be determined. Did the analysis use the right data and methodology? Was it free from the unconscious or conscious bias of someone influential?\n\n**More:** Watch Scott Cook's talk on [savoring surprises](https://vimeo.com/254376327).\n\n## RAPID for Complex Projects\n\nWhen practical, projects and decision-making should be run at the lowest possible level of the organization, by people who are closest to the facts and data.\n\nWhen a project is complex and involves many stakeholders, a different approach may be needed. We use a RAPID framework for complex, multi-stakeholder projects where clarity in the roles of stakeholders is vital.\n\nRAPID is an acronym for the five different roles a stakeholder might be asked to take on in a complex project: Recommend, Agree, Perform, Input, Decide.\n\nEach stakeholder can take on one or more roles:\n\n| Letter | Role | Responsibility |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| R | Recommend | Recommend a decision or action |\n| A | Agree | Formally agree with decision. Views - especially Obstacles - should be documented in final proposal shared |\n| P | Perform | Accountable for executing the decision once made |\n| I | Input | Provide input to a recommendation. Views may or may not be included in final proposal |\n| D | Decide | Make the decision and commit the organization to action |\n\n**More:** RAPID framework from [Bain Consulting](https://www.bain.com/insights/rapid-tool-to-clarify-decision-accountability/).\n",

This may be for different disciplines to review the work (for example, both development and design teams reviewing code changes to the user experience) and it may also be for reviewers with different levels of experience to share feedback.</p>\n<p>When reviewing significant user interface changes, code changes, responses to community or customers, or changes to systems or marketing material changes, it is ideal to have at least two reviewers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mini-boss:</strong> Reviewer less experienced in domain or Mattermost standards for the first review.</li>\n<li><strong>End-boss:</strong> Reviewer more experienced in domain or Mattermost standards for the final review for the discipline (e.g. development, design, documentation, etc.).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This system has several benefits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Mini-boss provides feedback on the most obvious issues, allowing the End-boss to focus on nuanced issues the Mini-boss didn\u2019t find.</li>\n<li>The Mini-boss learns from the End-boss feedback, understanding what was missed, and becoming a better reviewer.</li>\n<li>Eventually the Mini-boss will be as skilled at reviewing as the End-boss, who will have nothing further to add after the Mini-boss review. At this point, the Mini-boss becomes an End-boss, ready to train a new Mini-boss.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The naming of this term comes from video games, where a person submitting material for review must pass a \u201cmini-boss\u201d challenge before a \u201cend-boss\u201d challenge for different disciplines.</p>\n<h2>Savor Surprises</h2>\n<p>When we make important decisions quickly it's important to run at least a lightweight analysis to identify blindspots that could put success at risk. \"Savoring surprises\" means discussing unexpected findings from an analysis and understanding root cause in order to de-risk our original plan and/or find new opportunities.</p>\n<p>Example: In our early days, just months after launching our first commercial product Mattermost had a product roadmap for security and DevOps features that was vetted by customer roadmap reviews. We \"savored the surprise\" that custom emojis (which we assumed was a vanity feature to be cut) was highly important to support legacy processes that used them to communicate different outcomes of an automated process, like a build break. The surprise made our roadmap more valuable and effective.</p>\n<p>A good analysis will result in surprises uncovering blindspots. An analysis that has no surprises is a surprise in itself and the blindspot should be determined. Did the analysis use the right data and methodology? Was it free from the unconscious or conscious bias of someone influential?</p>\n<p><strong>More:</strong> Watch Scott Cook's talk on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/254376327\">savoring surprises</a>.</p>\n<h2>RAPID for Complex Projects</h2>\n<p>When practical, projects and decision-making should be run at the lowest possible level of the organization, by people who are closest to the facts and data.</p>\n<p>When a project is complex and involves many stakeholders, a different approach may be needed. We use a RAPID framework for complex, multi-stakeholder projects where clarity in the roles of stakeholders is vital.</p>\n<p>RAPID is an acronym for the five different roles a stakeholder might be asked to take on in a complex project: Recommend, Agree, Perform, Input, Decide.</p>\n<p>Each stakeholder can take on one or more roles:</p>\n<p>| Letter | Role | Responsibility |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| R | Recommend | Recommend a decision or action |\n| A | Agree | Formally agree with decision. Views - especially Obstacles - should be documented in final proposal shared |\n| P | Perform | Accountable for executing the decision once made |\n| I | Input | Provide input to a recommendation. Views may or may not be included in final proposal |\n| D | Decide | Make the decision and commit the organization to action |</p>\n<p><strong>More:</strong> RAPID framework from <a href=\"https://www.bain.com/insights/rapid-tool-to-clarify-decision-accountability/\">Bain Consulting</a>.</p>",
