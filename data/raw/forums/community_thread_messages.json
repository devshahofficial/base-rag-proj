Connectivity issues can sometimes be due to firewall settings or proxy configurations. Would you please check if there are any changes in these in your network?\n\nAnother thing concerns how tokens are being managed within your system. There could be issues if too many tokens are being generated, causing the system to reject newer ones. Hence, you may want to check with your system administrator about the token bucket size handling.\n\nIf none of these pointers help resolve your issue, it would be helpful if you could provide any error messages or console outputs you're getting when trying to connect. You can access the developer console from the desktop app by going to the 3-dot-menu > More Tools > Developer Tools, and then clicking on the 'Console' tab.\n\nI understand how vital staying connected with your team is, especially in this remote-work era. Rest assured, we are here to assist you in resolving this issue.\n\nBest,  \n~Mattermost AI Assistant ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

With Mattermost 10.0, we're excited to bring you the power of AI applied to the secure collaboration within Mattermost. In v10.0, users retain all the efficiency you've come to depend on from our platform without compromising on data control or deployment choice. See below for more details on the top focus areas:\n\nMitigate the risk of AI while delivering efficiency in a secure collaboration space\n\n  * Our Mattermost Copilot offering will provide a flexible LLM backend and the ease of using @mentions in channels and threads. Plus even more functionality will be available for enterprise installs to summarize threads and calls without sacrificing data control, productivity or security.\n\nCalls General Availability\n\n  * Our revamped Calls feature will offer live captioning, transcripts, and host controls, empowering your team to collaborate effectively across channels and platforms. Paired with our Mattermost Copilot solution, shave hours off your week by automating meeting summaries to channels.\n\nPlease check the below list for planned breaking changes for this release as well:\n\n  * MySQL - We will no longer support new installations using MySQL starting in v10. All new customers and/or deployments will only be supported with the minimum supported version of the PostgreSQL database. End of support for MySQL is targeted for Mattermost v11.\n  * Apps Framework - Apps framework will be deprecated in a future upcoming release. Please extend Mattermost using webhooks, slash commands, oAuth2 apps and plugins.\n  * Playbooks for Enterprise - An Enterprise license will be required to use v2.0+ Playbooks functionality starting in v10. Team Edition and Professional deployments can continue to use Playbooks v1.x. Security and feature updates will only be added to Playbooks v2.0+.\n\nAs always, we are committed to ensuring the best possible experience for you and your organization. We will support v9.11 (released in August, 2024) as our [last extended support release (ESR)](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/extended-support-release.html) for Mattermost version 9.x. This ESR will reach end of life in May, 2025, giving you ample time to plan for your upgrade to this new version.\n\nTo ensure your upgrade is smooth and easy, we've provided some FAQs below:\n\nFAQs\n\n  1. As an IT admin, what should I confirm before upgrading to Mattermost v10.0?\n\n\n  * If you're following the Mattermost upgrade guide with standard defaults, everything should go smoothly. Please double check [the upgrade guides](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/deployment.html#upgrade-mattermost) for guidance on the upgrade process.\n\n\n  2. What Desktop App and Mobile App versions are supported with Mattermost v10.0?\n\n\n  * Desktop Apps: For the most optimal experience we recommend upgrading to version 5.8 of the Desktop App. However, previous versions of the desktop application will still be backwards compatible.\n\n  * Mobile Apps: Mattermost native Mobile applications will also be backwards compatible with the Mattermost v10.0 updates. We recommend testing any custom-built apps with server v10.0 before releasing to production.\n\n\n\n  3. As an end user or organization, what's in it for me to look forward to in Mattermost v10.0?\n\n\n  * Mattermost v10.0 will offer the following AI-driven functionality for the first time: \n    * catch up quickly on unread channels, threads, and messages;\n    * invite Copilot into all conversations;\n    * clarify action items from Call-based meetings;\n    * and brainstorm privately with Copilot.",

The trick is you need to create an additional account in the clean Mattermost installation before you perform the import of your Slack data. Below is the full explanation of how I successfully migrated.\n\n  1. Determine the official name of your Slack instance (mine was something strange that didnt match the display name \u2013 e.g. my Slack name was something like this \"slackinstancenam-k948573\")\n\n  2. Export everything from your Slack instance. You can use this guide \u2192   \n<http://cosmicdiscord.net/2022-09-01-slack_migration/>\n\n  3. Stand up your new Mattermost instance. I did mine in Docker on my NAS.\n\n  4. Setup your new instance with the same email and username your admin account has in Slack. Your password doesn't matter (because it ends up getting reset as you found out). The Team / Organization name must match the one from Slack.\n\n  5. Setup SMTP in Mattermost!\n\n  6. **IMPORTANT:** Log into your new Mattermost instance and create a second super-user/admin with full privileges!  \nYou will have to do this via \"Invite Members\" in the Organization page (using a real email), then via the System Console you need to upgrade that user to a \"System Admin\"\n\n  7. Import your Slack Data to the new Mattermost Server with the mmctl tool\n\n  8. After the import process is complete Mattermost completely resets your admin user in the Mattermost instance. But it doesn't reset the second account you created.\n\n  9. Log in with the second account and reset your first account's password and grant it admin rights again.\n\n\n\n\nAll done!",

However, the option to do so is no longer available on the website, and we're being directed to contact the sales department.\n\nWe reached out to the sales team last week, but unfortunately, we haven't received a response yet. In the meantime, we're seeing warning messages in our workspace about the missing seat.\n\nCould you please help me expedite this process or provide an estimated timeframe for when we can expect to hear back from the sales department? I understand that contacting the sales team may be necessary, but it seems unnecessary for a simple license upgrade. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

Specifically, when file names contain Chinese characters, the sorting process behaves unexpectedly, causing the `a.name.localeCompare(b.name, locale, {numeric: true})` method to fail. As a result, the screen displays blank with no content.\n\nSteps to reproduce the issue:\n\n  1. Create or upload files with names containing Chinese characters.\n  2. Attempt to sort these files using the provided sorting function.\n\n\n\nExpected behavior: The files should be sorted correctly, even if their names contain Chinese characters, and the screen should display the sorted list without any issues.\n\nActual behavior: The sorting process fails, and the screen appears blank with no content.\n\nThis issue is severely impacting the usability of the system, especially for users who frequently work with files named in Chinese. I kindly request that you investigate and resolve this issue at your earliest convenience.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.",

Upon checking multiple issue types with different screens, most of the custom fields show as per Jira screen set, except from some. In Jira, the Team field that is used in Advanced Roadmaps, is set as a required field at Create. Team is displayed in Jira on all screens, however it does not show in Mattermost's create screen.\n\nIs this expected? Is there documentation on the fields that Mattermost can display? The other example I found was for time tracking, but that is optional field. The Team field not showing breaks out ability to create issues from MM. Is there a fix please, without changing the field requirement in Jira?\n\nThank you!",

Are there any particular frameworks or methodologies that you've found to be effective?\n\nHow do you handle authentication and authorization for these integrations securely? Additionally, I'm curious about any challenges you've encountered during the implementation process and how you overcame them.\n\nIf you have any tips, resources, or anecdotes to share, I would greatly appreciate it. Our goal is to streamline communication and enhance productivity within our team, and your insights would be invaluable in achieving that objective.\n\nhttps://docs.mattermost.com/about/integrations.html\n\nAlso, any assistance or guidance would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThankyou in advance.",

Integrations are a great way to tailor Mattermost to suit the specific needs of your organization.\n\nWhen developing custom integrations within Mattermost, I'd recommend exploring the Webhooks and Slash Commands features. These can be powerful when integrated with your external tools and are often great starting points. Our documentation does a pretty good job explaining these two, but here are the links for easy access:\n\n  * [Incoming Webhooks](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/webhooks/incoming/)\n  * [Outgoing Webhooks](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/webhooks/outgoing/)\n  * [Slash Commands](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/slash-commands/)\n\n\n\nTo handle authentication and authorization securely, Mattermost supports OAuth 2.0 for third party applications. We also provide Personal Access Tokens (PATs) for simpler scenarios where you might need to authenticate and authorize a script or a bot. These are both well-document on our developer's site.\n\nRegarding challenges, it varies greatly from team to team, integration to integration. One common challenge is often ensuring the integrations are scalable and maintainable. To overcome this, it's recommended to invest time in creating a good architectural layout before diving deep into the coding phase.\n\nThere's a plethora of learning resources available in our [developer documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/) as well.\n\nLastly, remember that this forum is an invaluable resource. Don't hesitate to share your challenges here as you progress, as many in this community have faced similar challenges and can offer guidance.\n\nBest of luck with your project. Remember that success in these sorts of endeavors often takes time and patience, so don't be discouraged by initial challenges. You're already on the right path by reaching out for advice!\n\nBest of luck,  \n~John ![:medal_military:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/medal_military.png?v=12)",

Here is a brief explanation and some steps to guide you:\n\n  1. **Create an incoming webhook in Mattermost**\n\n\n  * Head over to your Mattermost and click on \"Integrations.\"\n  * Choose \"Incoming Webhook.\"\n  * Note down the generated URL; you will need this in ServiceNow.\n\n\n  2. **Configure ServiceNow for the webhook**\n\n\n  * Go back to your ServiceNow instance.\n  * You have to create a script in business rules that triggers whenever the specific catalog item is updated (or based on your requirement).\n  * This script will send a POST request (via REST) with the catalog variable item details to the Mattermost incoming webhook URL you got from step 1.\n\n\n\nWith this setup, whenever your specific trigger in ServiceNow is activated, it will send notification details over to Mattermost\u2014preserving the specifics of your catalog variable item in its payload to display as an alert.\n\nIt's important to note that you may need to have good understanding on scripting in ServiceNow. Please make sure to test this out in a development instance before implementing it in a production environment.\n\nI hope this provides a starting point for your endeavor.

We absolutely love supporting individuals like you who are exploring and expanding on the capabilities of our platform.\n\nTo send a message from an external service to a Mattermost user, you will need to use the Mattermost API, more specifically, the [Create a Post](https://api.mattermost.com/#tag/posts%2Fpaths%2F~1teams~1%7Bteam_id%7D~1channels~1%7Bchannel_id%7D~1posts%2Fpost) method.\n\nThis method allows you to send a message to a specified channel. To message a specific user, you'd have to know the channel that you share with that user.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you could create a POST request in JavaScript:\n\n`var data = JSON.stringify({  \n\"channel_id\": \"{channel_id}\",  \n\"message\": \"This is a test message\",  \n\"props\": {}  \n});\n\nvar xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\nxhr.addEventListener(\"readystatechange\", function() {  \nif(this.readyState === 4) {  \nconsole.log(this.responseText);  \n}  \n});\n\nxhr.open(\"POST\", \"{your_mattermost_url}/api/v4/posts\");  \nxhr.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\");  \nxhr.setRequestHeader(\"Authorization\", \"Bearer {access_token}\");\n\nxhr.send(data);`\n\nRemember to replace `{channel_id}`, `{your_mattermost_url}`, and `{access_token}` with your specific information. The `access_token` will be for a bot user that you need to create and the `channel_id` is the ID of the channel shared by the bot and the user.\n\nKeep in mind that to call the API, you'll need to create a bot account and use the access token of that bot. You can find the relevant steps to do this in our [documentation on creating bot accounts](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/admin-guide/admin-bot-accounts/).\n\nI hope this helps get you started on your project. If you need any more assistance, this community and I are always here to support you.\n\nHappy coding!\n\nBest regards,  \n~Mattermost AI Assistant\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

Navigate to the System Console by clicking on `System Console` in the menu that appears when you click on your username in the top-left of the screen.\n  2. Click on `Users` under User Management in the left-hand sidebar.\n  3. Find the user that you would like to remove in the list. You can search for their username in the search box at the top.\n  4. Click on the `More Actions` (represented by three vertical dots) button against the username.\n  5. Select `Deactivate` from the dropdown menu. This will remove the user's access to the server and effectively remove them as a 'remote user'.\n\n\n\nPlease note that removing a user this way does not delete their past messages and activity. In other words, the historical data of that user will remain in the server.\n\nI hope this helps!

Problems with versions and dependencies can indeed make the initial stage a bit daunting. But I'm here to help, and together we'll navigate through it!\n\nIt seems that you've tried to explore both the web and server plugins, running into issues with older dependencies. Indeed, it might be that the environment specifications differ. However, before diving into that, let me offer some guidance on examples and resources for plugin development that will hopefully prove more straight-forward:\n\n  1. **Mattermost Plugin Examples** : Many plugin repositories started from the [starter template](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-starter-template), but they are now actively maintained and can serve as practical examples. A couple of examples are the [Demo Plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-demo) and [GitHub Plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-github)\n\n  2. **Keeping up-to-date with Mattermost Releases** : With Mattermost being a fast-evolving platform, it can be helpful to reference the [Mattermost Changelog](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/changelog.html). It provides important information about recent changes and deprecations.\n\n  3. **Discussion and Support** : The cornerstone of any open-source project is community collaboration. Don't hesitate to follow up on threads related to your plugin development journey or start a new conversation. There are many experienced developers in the community who may have tips or solutions to share!\n\n\n\n\nFor your issues with dependencies, it's indeed possible that some discrepancies between versions of various dependencies caused these mishaps. To debug and rule out environment-specific issues, could you please share more details on your development setup? (OS, Go version, Node.js version)\n\nCreating a second team, on another note, can be established easily. On the left-hand sidebar, click \"Add a new team\" at the bottom of your team list, and follow the instructions.\n\nI hope this gives you a good starting point, and feel free to ask for more clarification or assistance. I'm looking forward to seeing the plugins you'll develop!\n\nHappy coding!\n\n~Mattermost AI Assistant ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

                "message_content": "Getting somewhere with this. I'll make some notes here in case it helps someone else.\n\nFirstly, I'm focusing on a server-only plugin as that's all I need for now, so haven't got anywhere with making the web app part work.\n\nMM Plugins are created in the Golang programming language, and pretty much all the initial problems I experienced here relate to downstream code dependencies. Code dependencies are complex in Golang. Modules are downloaded in source form (typically from other Github repos), and then the go.mod and go.sum files are used to work out which versions of dependencies work together, before building the target. Dependencies can themselves depend on other things, and you end up with a spider's web of dependencies which can be difficult to untangle. The tooling normally takes care of this, but manual untangling this is messy.\n\nI started with the barebones plugin template (mattermost-plugin-starter-template). The problems I faced were:\n\n  * References to modules which don't exist (did exist at some point, but got renamed). There's a sourcegraph library, and an ASN.1 BER library.\n  * The build had WAAAY too many dependencies to be practical. There's a JSON encoder/decoder library (gojay) which somehow managed to depend on Google Cloud API modules. Long story short, this used over 5GB downloads and took more than 15 minutes to compile from cold. It's manageable if you're compiling all this stuff on a local machine because the dependencies get cached, but I build stuff in Github pipelines.\n\n\n\nThe fix for me was two-fold:\n\n  * Update everything to later dependencies which seemed to clear out all the references to packages which don't exist any more.\n  * Fixed the gojay library by taking out the gojay and examples directories which don't contain anything you need in a plugin. This involved forking the gojay library and deleting that stuff.\n\n\n\nDown to 300MB of downloaded modules, and builds from a clean module cache in 30 seconds.\n\nIf you're thinking of giving this a go maybe you would delete the go.sum file and replace the go.mod file with this\u2026\n\n```\nmodule example/module/name\n\ngo 1.20\n\nreplace github.com/francoispqt/gojay v1.2.13 => github.com/kalntera/gojay v0.0.0-20240119150629-2858d078a506\n\nrequire (\n\tgithub.com/gorilla/mux v1.8.1\n\tgithub.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/public v0.0.12\n\tgithub.com/pkg/errors v0.9.1\n\tgithub.com/stretchr/testify v1.8.4\n)\n```\n\nAnd then try `go mod tidy -e` and all the other stuff you normally do to compute dependencies e.g. install things when the errors tell you to. There's a reference there to [GitHub - kalntera/gojay: high performance JSON encoder/decoder with stream API for Golang (reduced dependencies)](http://github.com/kalntera/gojay) which is my copy of the gojay library. The replace line is used to switch out a module for a different one, that overrides the default gojay import.",

Your understanding is correct that the current version of Mattermost doesn't apply compression to images or videos out of the box.\n\nThat being said, for server efficiency and minimizing disk space usage, we completely understand the necessity for image and video compression, especially when large files are frequently shared.\n\nRegarding the `Mattermost Image Proxy`, it's actually a feature in the system console (not a plugin you can find in the marketplace) that allows you to automatically rewrite image URLs with a proxy URL. While this won't compress your images, it can definitely help maintain efficiency of your server. You can find more about it [here](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/image-proxy.html) in our official documentation.\n\nYour valuable feedback guides our improvements and changes. We're constantly working on enhancing user experience and we'll take your comment onboard to see if it's feasible for us to include such a feature in our future updates.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out if you have more questions or suggestions.

In the browser and client, I could only see the new message after I refreshed the page or switched the chat to someone else and back again. It works in principle, but I don't receive the messages directly.  \nOn the smartphone, the browser and in the client it shows me the following text: \"Please check connection, Mattermost unreachable.

We are sorry for the inconvenience that you've been facing.\n\nThe issue you're experiencing seems to be related to the WebSocket connection. Upon reviewing the logs you've provided, it appears there's an issue with upgrading the WebSocket connection. This is causing your browser and client apps to not update in real-time, and as instead, they're requiring manual refreshes. On the other hand, your smartphone app seems to receive push notifications, which work separately from WebSocket connections.\n\nBased on your error log, it seems like the origin of the requests might not be allowed as per the current configuration (`websocket: request origin not allowed by Upgrader.CheckOrigin`). To resolve this, you would need to check the settings related to allowing WebSocket connections, particularly those pertaining to \"allowed origins\".\n\nDepending on your setup, this may be due to some sort of reverse-proxy or firewall setting that is blocking or failing to correctly route the WebSocket connections. If you're using NGINX, Apache, or a similar service as a reverse proxy, make sure that they are correctly configured for WebSocket support.\n\nPlease also ensure that Mattermost is correctly configured to allow WebSocket connections. You can typically find this under \"Connections\" in the Mattermost system console.\n\nWithout a deeper understanding of your setup, it's hard to provide a more specific solution. However, I believe the above suggestions ought to provide a good starting point.\n\nFor further assistance, you might find helpful information in our [troubleshooting WebSocket connections guidance](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/mobile/push-notifications/troubleshoot/), or you may prefer to provide logs from your server, details about your specific setup, and details about any reverse proxy or firewall services you might be using.\n\nI hope this helps. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or if further clarification is needed.\n\nBest regards,  \n~Mattermost AI Assistant ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

These can sometimes inadvertently cause issues with domain recognition.\n\nIf you've gone through these steps and are still experiencing troubles, please feel free to provide any further details of your setup \u2013 it could help in diagnosing the problem.\n\nDon't worry, we'll get you up and running!\n\nBest Regards,  \n~Mattermost AI Assistant\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

These types of problems can be frustrating, but I'm confident we can work through them together!\n\nJust to confirm, it seems like the primary issue is expanding your VDISK (/dev/vda1). Given that your vda1 shows as being 100% utilized, that could definitely be why your Mattermost server isn't starting up\u2014it likely doesn't have enough space to handle its operations.\n\nThere are a few steps that we can try to resolve your issue:\n\n  1. **Expanding the Disk:** You mentioned that you've tried expanding the Vdisk, but it shows a maximum size of 72G. I recommend double-checking the methods you've used to expand, and making sure you followed documentation or expert advice rigorously.\n\n  2. **Checking for Disk Errors:** It's also worth running a fsck on your disk to look for and correct any potential errors. This can be done by entering the command `fsck /dev/vda1` in your terminal.\n\n  3. **Free Up Some Space:** As a quick fix for the out of space issue, try to clear some disk space. This could include removing old backups, cache, or even applications that you might not use.\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the error about failing to load configuration, it might be a separate issue, or it could be tied into the fact that your server is out of space. Your hunch about figuring out the proper way to expand the vda1 could indeed resolve the issues.\n\nRemember to always create a backup before making changes like these to your systems to avoid any loss of data!\n\nIf you need more detailed instructions or if these steps don't solve the issue, don't hesitate to get back in touch.

Regarding your question about performing a partial import of the Slack export to transfer missing old content, it is possible to achieve that by following these steps:\n\n  1. Ensure you have a complete and correct export from Slack, as you mentioned you have reexported everything.\n  2. Create a new Mattermost team or use an existing one where you would like to import the missing old content.\n  3. Go to the System Console of your Mattermost server and enable the \"Data Retention\" setting. This setting allows you to import data from another system.\n  4. On the Mattermost server, navigate to the \"Import\" section under the \"System Console.\"\n  5. Upload the complete Slack export file you obtained earlier.\n  6. Select the channels or conversations you want to import into Mattermost. Choose the specific channels where you want to transfer the missing old content.\n  7. Start the import process and wait for it to complete. This may take some time depending on the size of the export file.\n  8. Once the import is finished, you should see the missing old content from Slack in the selected channels of your Mattermost team.\n\n\n\nPlease note that this process will not remove any existing content from your Mattermost channels. It will only add the missing old content from Slack. Also, make sure to test this process in a non-production environment first to ensure everything works as expected.\n\nIf you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask for assistance.\n\nBest regards,  \n~Matterbot 2.0 ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This is a new AI response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

On the Mattermost server, navigate to the \"System Console\" and go to the \"Data Management\" section.\n  4. Under \"Data Management,\" you should find an option called \"Import Slack Archive.\" Click on it.\n  5. Upload the complete Slack export file you obtained earlier.\n  6. Select the channels or conversations you want to import into Mattermost. Choose the specific channels where you want to transfer the missing old content.\n  7. Start the import process and wait for it to complete. This may take some time depending on the size of the export file.\n  8. Once the import is finished, you should see the missing old content from Slack in the selected channels of your Mattermost team.\n\n\n\nPlease note that this process will not remove any existing content from your Mattermost channels. It will only add the missing old content from Slack. Also, make sure to test this process in a non-production environment first to ensure everything works as expected.\n\nIf you encounter any further issues or have additional questions, please let us know, and we'll be happy to assist you further.\n\nBest regards,  \n~Matterbot 2.0 ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This is a new AI response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

As in previous versions I plan to use it but some doubts come to my mind about the process :\n\n  * Due that the still valid ESR version is 8.1, I would say it would be fine to upgrade there. For achieving that goal, do I need to upgrade first to 7.8 and then to 8.1?.\n\n  * In this link Important Upgrade Notes \u2014 Mattermost documentation, for 7.8 version talks about new tables creation \" `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS RetentionIdsForDeletion`\" but I was wondering if that create should be launched by the sysadmin or the own upgrade process handle that?. For some other versions, it talks too about doing other things than a simple select so\u2026 that changes should be done by the sysadmin or as commented is totally handled by the upgrade process?.\n\n  * We have the following plugins in use (some of them installed by default), could you know if something is expected to be broken in the new version :\n\n[List of plugins omitted for brevity]\n\nI will explore all new features as calls plugin but\u2026 my main need is to have Mattermost upgraded for security reasons and just it to work the way is working today\u2026 basically that\u2026\n\nDo you think or could you know if I would have issues with this versions/env or is some sort of that known?.\n\nI plan to test all these in a testing env but, just for having the experienced people ideas :slight_smile: :slight_smile:\n\nVery thankful for your help and time,\nCheers!",

We are excited to see you working on developing a chat bot application!\n\nLet's help you sort out the issue you're facing. When it comes to external apps in Mattermost, direct messages to the app's bot are generally captured using `Subscribe` call. In your app, you want to subscribe to events that occur in Mattermost. This is done by defining what events your app should listen for in the `OnActivate` function in your App's code. You can specify a number of event types, including direct messages to the bot.\n\nFor example, in the `OnActivate` function of your application, you would have something like this:\n\napp.OnActivate = func(_ apps.Context, conf apps.Config) error {  \n_, err := p.mm.Apps.KVSet(AppKey, conf)  \nif err != nil {  \nreturn err  \n}\n    \n    \n     return p.mm.Apps.Subscribe(&apps.Subscription{\n        Subject:   apps.SubjectBotDMPosted,\n        ChannelID: conf.BotAccessTokenChannel,\n        AppID:     AppID,\n     })\n    \n\n}\n\nThe above code subscribes your app to events that happen whenever a direct message is sent to your app's bot. You will then need to implement the logic that should occur when these events happen as a webhook.\n\nKeep in mind that you will also need to make sure your bot is properly activated on the Mattermost platform for this to work properly.\n\nFor more details, you may refer to this section of the Mattermost developer documentation: [Subscribe](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/apps/call-responses/#subscriptions).\n\nI hope this points you in the right direction. If you have any more questions about your application, please don't hesitate to ask.

That's a great start!\n\nRegarding your question about daily reminders displaying in a public channel for everyone to see - Yes, it's absolutely possible! If you set up a dedicated channel for calendar reminders, you can use the `/calendar connect` command within that channel. This will ensure that the daily reminders are sent to that specific channel, making them visible to all the server members who have access to it.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that currently only the events from the user who set up the integration will be displayed. If you'd like the events from more users or another specific user to appear in the channel, you'll need to have them set up the integration as well.\n\nBut don't worry, you can still control which events display reminders by adjusting the settings when creating the event.\n\nDo let me know if you need more assistance, always here to help!\n\nBest Regards,\n~John",

HIPAA and FINRA compliance capability is built into the design of both these options.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that while Mattermost provides tools designed to support your HIPAA and FINRA compliance, the actual compliance will depend heavily on how these tools are used within your organization. For example, maintaining appropriate access controls, managing user behaviors, performing regular audits, and training your staff are crucial parts of the compliance process.\n\nIn terms of documentation, the guide you mentioned is applicable to both options\u2014self-managed and cloud/managed. For specific information on the cloud/managed instances, you might want to check out our [cloud security overview](https://docs.mattermost.com/cloud/cloud-security/) document.\n\nI hope this clarifies your query.

I appreciate your putting forth this query.\n\nIn Mattermost, new messages should by default appear in their respective channels and threads. When a new message is posted in a channel you are a member of, that channel should indeed highlight itself. This is a feature that has remained consistent across our versions, including in Mattermost 9.2.2.\n\nHowever, I understand this might not be the case for you currently. We have a few troubleshooting steps that you can try:\n\n  1. Please go to 'Account Settings' \u2192 'Notifications' \u2192 'Channel Notifications' and ensure you've set \"Notify me about\" to \"All Activity\". This should ensure you get notified for all new messages in your channels.\n\n  2. If that doesn't work, there could be a small glitch affecting your UI. Consequently, a quick refresh or a reinstallation of the app (if you're using the desktop/mobile app versions) might be a possible quick fix.\n\n  3. If neither of these resolve the situation, there might be a larger issue at play. In that case, I kindly advise raising a bug report to our developers via the 'Report a Problem' option under 'Help' on your Mattermost platform.\n\n\n\n\nI hope this information is helpful. Please don't hesitate to ask if you have further questions or need additional assistance.\n\nBest regards,  \n~Mattermost AI Assistant\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

This means you have access to all source code and can absolutely develop on it. You can find the code for our server and client on our GitHub organization at [Mattermost \u00b7 GitHub](https://github.com/mattermost).\n\nHowever, if you're looking for the enterprise features, Mattermost offers an Enterprise Edition which comes with additional proprietary features not available in the free open source version. While the core platform remains open source, these premium features are not, and the source code for them won't be shared.\n\nRegarding whether any processes go through official servers, Mattermost's intelligent backend and deployment options ensure you maintain complete control over your data and infrastructure, there are no forced connections back to Mattermost or other outside servers.\n\nConcerning the pricing details for the Enterprise Edition, it depends on the number of users and the specific Enterprise features you are interested in. You can view the different plans and pricing on our website at [Pricing | Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/pricing/).\n\nIn case of further questions, need for clarification or assistance, don't hesitate to reply or create a new topic!\n\nBest regards,  \n~Mattermost AI Assistant ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

Enable Debug Mode: Open your Mattermost configuration file (`config.json`) and set the `EnableDebugging` option to `true`. This will enable more detailed logging.\n2. Restart Mattermost: Restart the Mattermost server to apply the changes made in the configuration file.\n3. Check the Logs: The logs can provide valuable information for debugging. On Linux, you can typically find the logs in the following locations:\n  * Mattermost Server Logs: `/var/log/mattermost/mattermost.log`\n  * Mattermost Web App Logs: Open your web browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12), and switch to the \"Console\" tab. This will display any error messages or warnings related to the Mattermost web app.\n4. Reproduce the Issue: Try to reproduce the issue you are facing while keeping an eye on the logs. This will help you identify any specific error messages or warnings related to the problem.\n5. Search the Mattermost Forum and GitHub Issues: The Mattermost community forum and GitHub issues are great resources to find solutions to common problems. Search for keywords related to your issue to see if others have faced similar problems and found solutions.\n6. Enable Extended Logging: If the default logging level is not producing enough information to debug the issue, you can increase the logging level to \"DEBUG\" or \"INFO\" in your Mattermost configuration file (`config.json`). Remember to restart Mattermost after making changes.\n7. Use Developer Tools: If you are facing issues with the Mattermost web app, you can open your web browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12) and switch to the \"Network\" tab to monitor network requests and responses. The \"Console\" tab can also provide useful information about any JavaScript errors or warnings.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to gather more information about the issue you are facing with Mattermost on Linux and work towards finding a solution.\n\nBest regards,\n~Matterbot 2.0 \ud83e\udd16\n\n[Disclaimer: This is a new AI response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

In the GitHub example:\n\n  * Scan the last 30 GitHub issues in this channel, and find the one that looks easiest to complete.\n  * What issue looks like the hardest to complete?\n  * Which issue seems like it might have security implications?\n\n\n\nThe framework for this connectivity is open source, so you can take the source code from our GitHub example and adapt it to your custom systems for real-time ingestion and analysis.\n\nAll this and more coming soon to <https://openops.mattermost.com>",
