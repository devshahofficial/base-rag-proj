Here are the steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:\n\n1. **Check Server Status**: It might be a temporary issue with the server, so it's worth checking again after a few minutes.\n2. **Refresh Your Browser/Page**: Try refreshing the page (press F5 or ctrl + r). In many cases, a quick refresh can fix the problem\n3. **Clear Your Browser's Cache**: Outdated or corrupted files that are being stored by your browser could be causing this issue. Clearing your browser's cache might solve the problem.\n4. **DNS Issue**: This could be a DNS issue. Flushing your DNS cache might help.\n5. **Checking Server Logs**: Check your server logs, both on your Mattermost server and on any reverse proxy server you're using in front of it. They might contain important information about what's going wrong.\n6. **Configure the Reverse Proxy Correctly**: If you're using a reverse proxy server (like Nginx or Apache), ensure it's configured properly to work with Mattermost. You might be seeing this issue because of incorrect configuration.\n7. **Check with ISP/Hosting Provider**: If the problem persists, the issue might be with the Internet Service Provider or hosting service. Reach out to them for support.\n\nRemember, a 502 error is usually an issue on the server-side, so you might not be able to resolve it on your own. But you can certainly try these steps to see if the problem can be resolved.\n\nIf you're still having issues clearing your 502 error and logging into Mattermost, please post a new thread in our [Troubleshooting](https://forum.mattermost.com/c/trouble-shoot/16) forum with your Mattermost version number and issue summary.",

                "user_name": "cwarnermm",
                "message_content": "**Yes!**\n\nIn order to use JumpCloud as a SAML provider for Mattermost, you will need a few things:\n\n  * A Mattermost Professional or Enterprise licence (SAML integration is not available on the free version)\n  * Admin access to your Mattermost System Console\n  * Admin access to your JumpCloud environment\n\n\n\nYou will also need to make a note of your Mattermost URL.\n\nFor a complete walkthrough of setting up this integration, see the [Mattermost - JumpCloud Integration: A Step-by-Step Guide to SAML Authentication](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=evXjZcSqvoE&ab_channel=Mattermost) video on YouTube, or follow the steps below.\n\n**Setting Up JumpCloud**  \nBefore you start, it is helpful to already have one or more [User Groups](https://jumpcloud.com/support/get-started-user-groups) in JumpCloud, with [users](https://jumpcloud.com/support/get-started-users) already assigned. This will make life easier when you come to test the integration later.\n\nFrom the left-hand menu in JumpCloud, select \"SSO\" (under \"USER AUTHENTICATION\"):  \n![jumpcloud-sso](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/mattermost/original/2X/d/d7975c8bf39f965dd1c8caab6dcf41bf86eaf59c.png)\n\nIf you don't currently have any SSO applications configured, you will see a \"Get Started\" button at the bottom of the screen:  \n![get-started](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/mattermost/original/2X/1/1565716a52dc03dcc60050d1214252f1660662ac.png)\n\nOtherwise, there will be a button labelled \"Add New Application\" in the upper left of the main screen:  \n![add-new-app](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/mattermost/original/2X/8/8b1f83686e67849df999b0256f8787937d4c975c.png)\n\nWhichever option you have, click the button to create a new SSO integration. From the next page, we need to select the \"Custom SAML App\" from the bottom of the screen:  \n![custom-saml-app](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/mattermost/original/2X/d/d90ba11903e07e49cb191a245a6d275c5fbce9ac.png)\n\nGive this app a name using the \"Display Label\" field (we recommend calling it 'Mattermost' so that the purpose of the integration is clear). We can now switch to the SSO tab for the main configuration:  \n![sso-tab](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/mattermost/original/2X/6/660dfcef4adeb3eec43c9b1dcce0973a362422cb.png)\n\nTowards the bottom of this page, there is a field where you can define your IDP URL. This is made up of a fixed portion (which may be different to the examples on this page) and a custom portion. The custom portion defaults to 'saml2', but may need to be changed if this is already in use within your environment.  \n![idp-url](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/mattermost/original/2X/f/f266abc323736efe3c095e4dd00345caed593c68.png)\n\nWhatever you choose for the custom portion of this URL, make a note of the entire URL, as we'll need it as we progress.\n\nBack at the top of the page, there are fields for the **IdP Entity ID** and the **SP Entity ID**. The 'IdP Entity ID' is simply the 'IDP URL' that you just noted. The 'SP Entity ID' (SP stands for \"Service Provider\") is used to match with Mattermost. We recommend using the string: `mattermost`\n\nWe need to enter an **ACS URL** so that JumpCloud knows where to send SAML responses. This will be: `http(s)://<MATTERMOST_URL>/login/sso/saml`\n\nRemember to include the port number in your Mattermost URL, if you're not using the defaults of 80/443.\n\nScroll down to the bottom of the form, leaving everything set to the defaults. At the very bottom, there is a section titled 'Attributes'. This allows us to specify what fields in Mattermost will be called when we map them across to JumpCloud, the key ones being for the `email` and `username` fields. To keep things clear, we would advise using the same attribute names in both systems.\n\nTo do this, we need two entries, mapping `email` to `email`, and `username` to `username`.  \n![add-attribute](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/mattermost/original/2X/b/b85345c7686ced5e187ab28915a78c5c61fafb61.png)\n\nBefore leaving the JumpCloud configuration, we recommend going to the \"User Groups\" tab at the top of the page and adding one or more user groups to this configuration. This will map users already, making testing easier.\n\nOnce complete, press the **activate** button at the lower right of the page.\n\nAfter activating and confirming, you will be presented with a notification in the upper right of the page giving you a link to download the certificate. We will require this when we configure Mattermost.\n\nBefore moving on, it would be helpful to copy the JumpCloud Metadata URL from the SSO tab, as we'll need this when we setup Mattermost:  \n![copy-metadata-url](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/mattermost/original/2X/d/dd263f2d2fee7a1ae1d0fae95454d05a2cd1166a.png)\n\n**Setting Up Mattermost**  \nIn the Mattermost System Console, scroll down the left-hand navigation until you find **SAML 2.0** in the \"AUTHENTICATION\" section.  \n![mattermost-saml-20](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/mattermost/original/2X/1/100e7fedba0c141ea7e65c17284cf166a43467f1.png)\n\nTo configure Mattermost to use JumpCloud's SAML, carry out the following steps:\n\n  * Enable the SAML section by setting **Enable Login With SAML 2.0** to **true**\n\n  * Paste the copied JumpCloud Metadata URL into the field labelled **Identity Provider Metadata URL**\n\n  * Within JumpCloud, we identified the **IDP URL**. Copy and paste this URL into both the **SAML SSO URL** and **Identity Provider Issuer URL** fields.\n\n  * Next we need to upload the certificate that we downloaded from JumpCloud. Note that the name of the file changes to `saml-idp.crt` after uploading.  \n![upload-cert](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/mattermost/original/2X/0/084c6854eaf43ee51ace75ea503e0442eb2d26b8.png)\n\n  * The **Service Provider Identifier** field should match the entry used for the **SP Entity ID** field in JumpCloud. If you're following our guidelines, then this would be `mattermost`.\n\n  * By default, you will see that the **Enable Encryption** field is set to 'true'. This is not supported by JumpCloud, so **must** be set to 'false'.\n\n  * Towards the bottom of the page, we see the fields **Email Attribute** and **Username Attribute**. These should be configured to match the attributes set in JumpCloud\u2014in our case, we are using `email` and `username`.\n\n  * Finally, at the very bottom of the form, you can choose to set your **Login Button Text** to make it clear how users will be signing in. This will then show as the optional SAML option at the bottom of their login screen.",

Please proceed with caution\n\nNOTE: If you operate a highly-available Mattermost cluster these steps must be applied to all Mattermost Server application nodes\n\nWARNING: These changes will need to be re-applied any time there is an upgrade to Mattermost server\n\nThere are a variety of reasons why you may need to remove the built in emojis that Mattermost ships with. For this post I'll bucket them all under one heading of \"Not appropriate for end-user community\".\n\nMattermost ships with a large library of existing emoji that is similar to what is available through your device operating system keyboard (see our docs on how to access the OS/keyboard emoji on different clients), but not exactly the same. The following steps explain how you can manually remove a specific emoji from the Mattermost client. Note, this will not affect the emoji that are available from your keyboard.\n\n1. Identify the name of the emoji you want to remove. On the desktop client you can open the emoji picker and hover over the one you want to remove. In the following screenshot I'm hovering over the poop emoji, so the name is `hankey`. Make note of this term, and the other terms which are aliases of this emoji.\n\n2. Under the Mattermost installation directory `INSTALL_DIR` (typically `/opt/mattermost`) navigate to the `INSTALL_DIR/client`\n\n3. There are 2 files you'll need to edit and they are very dense with characters (these are minified/process javascript files). First you need to find the files.\n\n4. Backup the `js` file somewhere in case you make a mistake. Open the `js` file and search for the emoji you want to remove. There are 2 places where the emoji should appear:\n\na) See following image. All 3 versions of the poop emoji are listed (\"hankey\", \"poop\", \"shit\"). We need to remove all of this `[\\\"hankey\\\",79],[\\\"poop\\\",79],[\\\"shit\\\",79],` (NOTE: The trailing comma must be removed too\u2026 this is part of a list). Save the file in place.\n\nb) See the following screenshot. Remove the entire json block (including trailing comma) that starts with \"aliases\" `{\"aliases\":[\"hankey\",\"poop\",\"shit\"],\"filename\":\"1f4a9\",\"category\":\"people\",\"batch\":\"2\"},`\n\n5. Backup the `js.map` file somewhere in case you make a mistake. Open the `js.map` file and search for the emoji you want to remove the same as in step 4. All 3 versions need to be removed. This file was extra tricky as the size really made my editor slow down. Save the file in places.\n\n6. Hard refresh your Mattermost client (CTRL/CMD-R).\n\n7. Search the emoji picker for the emoji you just deleted. Confirm it is no longer available.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.",

                "message_content": "FYI - An issue was discovered with the above approach. The approach results in emoji being shifted in the UI, and images are not aligned to their correct emoji\u2026 which further emphasizes the risks of going this route. But if you absolutely MUST remove an emoji for some reason, these steps below seem to work as well:\n\n1. Restore the 2 files you edited to remove the problematic emoji (one was `*.js` , and one was `*.js.map` ). They should be back to their original state, where they would show the problematic emoji. Remember to do this on all 3 app servers.\n2. Again, going into those same 2 files, you're going to do something different. Instead of removing blocks that related to the emoji, you're now going to edit them with a different name, and have them point to a different (blank) file.\n\nSo, for me, my files have modifications like this:\n\n`main.a899b9c055b3c3ecbac7.js` :\n\n`{\"aliases\":[\"transparent\"],\"filename\":\"transparent-64x64\",\"category\":\"flags\",\"batch\":\"5\"}`\n\n`main.a899b9c055b3c3ecbac7.js.map`\n\n`,[\\\"transparent\\\",1401]`\n\nFinally, copy the attached transparent png file `transparent-64x74.png` under the following folder:\n\n`/opt/mattermost/client/emoji`",
