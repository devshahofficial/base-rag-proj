Scheduled messages is a feature that we've received a lot of requests for and the design team has been working on solutions that we'd like to share out in the open. If you're interested in this feature, we'd love your feedback. Below is a quick summary of the feature. We're also working on a more in-depth UX specification here if you want to get in to the details.\n\n#### Send a message for a later time/date\n\nThe first noticeable change you'll see in the proposed design is the send button will be a new segmented control that gives users the ability to open a new 'Schedule message' menu to choose preset scheduled times or to select a custom time to send the message.\n\nOptions in this menu will display dynamically as follows:\n\n  * `Tomorrow at 9:00 AM` will always be the first option\n  * `Monday at 9:00 AM` will only show as an option if it's Friday or Saturday\n  * If the user had recently chosen a custom scheduled time, that time will show as an option in the menu as well.\n\nWhen this menu is engaged, the menu will focus on the first item (Tomorrow at 9:00 AM) by default and a quick 'ENTER' on the keyboard will schedule it. UP and DOWN on the keyboard will also navigate through the options in the menu, while ESC will close it.\n\nUsers can choose a custom date and time through the Schedule message dialog.\n\nWhen a message is scheduled, a notice appears above the message input box letting the user know they have a scheduled message in this channel.\n\n### Viewing scheduled messages in the Drafts view\n\nAll scheduled messages will then be accessible through the existing 'Drafts' view with identifying labels for scheduled messages along with the date/time they will be sent. From here, users will be able to change the schedule, edit the message content, or delete the message\n\n### Let us know what you think\n\nSo, that's a very quick summary of the feature. Is this a feature you would find value in? We'd love to hear from you.",

Scheduling would be very useful to send a message to a team (or a colleague) in a different timezone so that they receive it in the beginning of their day (sometimes better than during the night).\n\nIt's also useful when you have an idea to send to your team or colleagues but it's completely outside working hours or days. Like you remember something to share with your team during the weekend, but it's not so urgent to send it immediately. You can schedule it in Mattermost and you know it will pop up on Monday 9:00 am so it's not lost!\n\nMany thanks anyway for making this idea closer to reality!",

Attributes like location, pronouns, and phone number are key to understanding who they're communicating with and how to work together. These additional attributes are often different for each organization.\n\nIn addition, enterprise customers need to leverage AD/LDAP or SAML as the centralized source of truth for profile attributes like this at scale. The ability to link with these directory services is very important in large deployments.\n\nWe're pleased to share that we are actively working on this feature and would like to share an early preview of the latest solution design. Here's a summary of what we're actively designing.\n\n# Configuring custom properties\n\n[Image of custom properties configuration]\n\nWithin the system console, a new 'System properties' page will be added where admins can:\n\n  * Add new user properties\n  * Edit the name, type and options for a given property\n  * Link properties with LDAP or SAML attributes (if connected)\n  * Re-order custom properties\n  * Adjust other property settings\n\n## Standard vs. custom properties\n\nWithin the user properties section, we will also include standard properties along with custom properties. Standard properties are built-in properties like username, email, full name, etc., which cannot be deleted since they are core product properties for users. They can be linked to AD/LDAP/SAML attributes from this view if these services are configured.\n\n## Adding new properties\n\nIn the custom properties table, admins can click 'Add property' to add a new row and define the property's name and type.\n\n[Image of adding new properties]\n\n## Reordering properties\n\nDrag-and-drop to re-order table rows to adjust how they will display on profiles.\n\n[Image of reordering properties]\n\n## Editing a property\n\nClick inside the property name's cell to edit the name directly. Pressing enter or clicking outside will commit the change.\n\n[Image of editing a property]\n\n### Property type\n\nThe type allows a property to be formatted and validated in specific ways. Some possible types may include: Text, Number, Email, Phone, URL, Select, Multi-Select, Date, Person.\n\n[Image of property types]\n\n### Property value options\n\nFor the Select and Multi-select property types, preset options can be added for end users to choose from.\n\n[Image of property value options]\n\n## Linking properties with LDAP or SAML attributes\n\nIf LDAP or SAML are configured in the system, admins can link properties with attributes from these providers. When linking a profile property in Mattermost, simply type in the LDAP or SAML attribute name to map the property to and select it to make the linkage. Once linked successfully, it will display in the properties table.\n\n[Image of linking properties]\n\n### Additional settings\n\n  * **Set the property's visibility:** you may have custom properties you want to add, but don't want displayed. This may be the case if you have a property that is not filled in for some users. With this setting, you can choose to: Always show, Hide when empty, or Always hide.\n  * **Allow allow end users to add their own options:** in the case where a select or multi-select type has preset options, you may want to allow end users to add their own options when filling in their profile.\n  * **Duplicate a property**\n  * **Delete a property**\n\n# Displaying custom profile properties\n\nIn a user's profile settings, any new custom fields will display for each property that has been added in the system console.\n\n[Image of user profile settings]\n\nIn the user profile popover, only a subset of profile properties can show due to available real estate. A new 'view profile' button displays in the footer. Users can view a detailed view of the user profile in a new profile right-side panel.\n\n[Image of user profile popover]\n\n# Share your feedback\n\nThis is an early preview and the initial iteration of this may be scaled back or it may go through some changes, but this is the latest thinking for the feature. We have even bigger ideas and plans that could leverage such a properties system, but for now custom profile properties is a great first step.\n\nWe'd love to hear your feedback. Send us a reply here and let us know what you think.",

Our aim is to give admins more control over user access to LLMs and the data the LLMs have access to. This will offer the ability to create multiple bots with specific purposes that will only be available to specific users. For example, you could have a general-purpose AI bot for your team, but you need to block HR channel data or HR team members from using it due to sensitive data and conversations. You could also have a bot that is tied to a local LLM that has wider access to users and content in the system with no concerns about data leaving your organization.\n\nThese new settings would replace the current 'user restrictions' settings in the existing plugin.\n\n## User access control options\n\nFor user-based access controls, a new set of options is available. Admins can allow access for all users, allow only selected users, or block selected users.\n\n### Allowing specific users\n\nWhen 'Allow selected users' is chosen, a field displays for admins to enter individual users, LDAP groups, or entire Mattermost teams. Once saved, these users or groups will be the only ones allowed to access this bot.\n\n### Blocking specific users\n\nWhen 'Block selected users' is chosen, a similar field displays for admins to enter users, LDAP groups, or teams. Once saved, these users will be the blocked from using this bot. All other users will be able to access the bot.\n\n## Channel access options\n\nWith these proposed updates, we will also provide control for the LLM's access to channels. Admins can allow all channels to be accessible, allow only selected channels, or block selected channels.\n\n### Allowing specific channels\n\nWhen 'Allow specific channels' is chosen, a field displays for admins to enter individual channels or entire Mattermost teams. Once saved, these channels will be the only ones allowed to access this bot. Data from all other channels will not be accessible to the LLM.\n\n### Blocking specific channels\n\nWhen 'Block selected channels' is chosen, a field displays for admins to enter individual channels or entire Mattermost teams. Once saved, data from these channels will not be accessible to this LLM. Data from all other channels will be accessible to the bot.\n\n## What do you think about this capability?\n\nWould this suit your organization's needs for AI access control in Mattermost? What would you like to see? Drop us a line here in this forum post and let us know what you think. We are validating this concept with customers and users so all feedback helps us solidify the solution.",

There are three potential paths forward:\n\n  1. Subscribe to all chat messages across all channels (`/teams/getAllMessages`). This requires application level permissions, as well as a careful permissions check to only forward an `@mention` if the user actually had access to the message in question.\n  2. Subscribe to handful of administrator configured channels (`/teams/{id}/channels/{id}/messages`). This could potentially be done with delegated permissions (for the administrator), but still requires a careful permission check to selectively forward any `@mentions`.\n  3. Work with Microsoft to introduce a new, delegated Graph API subscription for a user's messages across all channels.\n\n\n\nThis last option might look like a subscription against `/users/{id}/teams/getAllMessages`, notifying for all channel messages in an organization of which the given user is a member, with the integration doing the work of deciding when to notify based on the presence of a mention. Optionally, the Graph API endpoint might only notify for @mentions, with a subscription against `/users/{id}/teams/getAllMentions` only notifying if the user is explicitly mentioned in a post, but a more general purpose API would be more flexible.\n\nThere are existing APIs that get close. At first glance, `/users/{id}/chats` ([see docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/teams-changenotifications-chatmessage#subscribe-to-changes-at-the-user-level)) suggests the ability to \"track messages across all chats a particular user is part of\", but testing confirms this is only for chats and group chats \u2013 not channel chat messages.\n\nThere is also `/teams/{team-id}/channels/{channel-id}/messages?$filter=mentions/any(u: u/mentioned/user/id eq '{id}')` ([see docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/teams-changenotifications-chatmessage#example-4-subscribe-to-messages-and-replies-in-a-channel-that-mention-a-specific-user), as well as the [chats version](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/teams-changenotifications-chatmessage#example-4-subscribe-to-message-in-a-chat-in-which-a-specific-user-is-mentioned)), but requires a subscription per channel. It's also not clear if it checks if the user is actually a member, so may still require the permissions check.\n\nFeedback on the above approaches or perhaps anything we've missed would be very welcome!",

                "message_content": "We have heard from our customers that it can be confusing to know which search to use for the different types of content in Mattermost. Some users expect to be able to find channels by using global search bar at the top. Other users expect to use the global search bar to find people. In reality, neither of these can be found here; only messages and files can be found through the global search bar.\n\nAdditionally, in workspaces with multiple teams, it can be very difficult to find what you're looking for when you may not recall which team or channel the content may live in. Currently, you can only search the active team and cannot get results across all of your teams. There is no way to perform a keyword search across all your teams.\n\nFor this design preview, we aim to address these problems through key improvements to the search experience.\n\nShort disclaimer: These enhancements are currently in the design phase and have not yet been slotted on the roadmap, so we do not yet have a release target. We'll be validating these designs with customers and iterating on them over the next few months.\n\nSolution Part 1: Combined Search\n\nThe first part of the solution brings all the core search mechanisms into one combined search panel. Rather than having to remember which search modal to use for each purpose, we are proposing one unified search experience.\n\nThis new UI brings the search for channels, messages, files, and people in one place. A tab bar across the top indicates the current search mode and users can click to change that mode. This also makes way for another feature we've previewed recently: Copilot search which is an AI-enhanced search method we're working on.\n\nFinding channels\n\nUsing the existing COMMAND-K/CTRL-K keyboard shortcut will open the new search modal, with the channel search selected. This replaces the existing 'find channels' modal and brings all of it's functionality in this combined search view. Unreads and recent channels show as suggestions before you start typing. As you typing channel results narrow down by relevancy.\n\nFinding messages\n\nUsing the COMMAND/CTRL-F keyboard shortcut will open the new search modal, with the messages tab selected. Recent searches show as suggestions before you start typing.\nThe existing search modifiers are still available and show at the bottom of the modal as tips. Clicking on these modifiers adds them to the search field.\n\nFinding files\n\nFile search is another method that will carry over existing search capability into the new unified search modal. Recent searches and recently added files in your channels show as suggestions prior to typing a search. Modifiers are also available here.\n\nFinding people\n\nTo alleviate some of the confusion we've heard about searching for colleauges, a new 'People' search tab has been added which offers the ability to find specific users you'd like to message with. Before you start typing, we show suggestions based on who you chat with most or who you may have had a recent DM with. As you type the results narrow by relevance. Clicking on a result will open the DM with that user.\n\nCopilot search\n\nIf you have Copilot configured for search, the 'Copilot' tab displays in the search modal.\nWith this method, users can search by 'meaning' rather than keywords or ask specific questions to find answers from the content. We have highlighted this feature in greater detail in this forum post.\n\nSolution Part 2: Cross-team search\n\nAs part of the Messages and Files search method, this proposal provides the ability to filter by a single team, multiple teams, or all your teams. This provides the capability to search everything they have access to in the workspace.\n\nThe search results right panel could also include the team filter to show results across all teams or a specific team of choice.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nAs always, we'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback on these solutions. What pain points might this solve for you?\n\nIf you'd like to dive deeper in to some of the specifics around the combined search UX, have a look at our early UX spec.",

The existing search functions for messages and files will remain the same, but with a refreshed interface and a new tab for AI search.\n\nQuery AI for answers across the workspace\n\nWhen \"AI Copilot\" is selected as the search method, users will be able to query across all the conversations they have access to (and only those they have access to) to find the most relevant answers to their questions. This enables users to search in a more topical manner, rather than the standard keyword-based search.\n\n[Images of AI search interface]\n\nAI Copilot Search Results\n\nOnce a search is executed, the AI Copilot right panel opens up with a streaming response of the summarized answer to your query.\n\n[Image of search results]\n\nAnswers with links to the original source content\n\nThe references to the original source content are linked inline and in an expandable section below the answer.

Starting in our June release (version 9.9), Team Edition and Enterprise Free edition (also known as E0) will see Mattermost branding along with a 'Free edition' label.\n\nThis labeling and branding will display on the login screen and in the main application header.\n\n[Image descriptions omitted]\n\nThis label will also be displayed in the bottom of the product menu with some additional language to indicate that the free edition does not include commercial support.\n\n[Image description omitted]\n\n## Why we are making these changes\n\nWe're making this change to make it clear that Mattermost's Free Edition doesn't include customer support via email and tickets from Mattermost, Inc. In the current state, without this change, we are receiving too many support tickets and emails from non-paying users, which complicates our ability to support paying users effectively and efficiently. This is unfair to our paying users.\n\nBy making it clear to end users using the free and unsupported version of Mattermost that they aren't entitled to paid support will increase our ability to support paying customers.\n\n## How will these changes affect you?\n\n  1. For customers with Professional or Enterprise licenses, your workspace will not be affected at all. In fact, we are looking at ways to add more value to the experience for our Enterprise customers with enhanced custom branding tools in the future. Have a look at [this forum post](https://forum.mattermost.com/t/design-preview-custom-branding-enhancements/18575) if this interests you.\n  2. For those using the free Team Edition or Enterprise Free Edition (commercial, free version), you will begin to see Mattermost branding in the application along with a \"Free Edition\" label.\n  3. For those who wish to compile their own version from the [publicly available source code](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost) and change or remove these labels, this option is always available. If you are compiling from source code and distributing the modified version to an outside party, you need to remove \"Mattermost\" branding so the outside party doesn't think your version is a paid offering from Mattermost, Inc. You will also need to follow the requirements of the open source license in the Mattermost code base.\n\n## Share your feedback with us\n\nWe're interested to hear from our community on these updates. If you have thoughts or feedback for the Mattermost team, please feel free to share with us in a reply to this forum post.",

Having an experience that is tailored to their brand allows for:\n\n- A consistent brand identity where mission-critical communication happens\n- A more familiar environment for the team's virtual office\n- A sense of ownership of the collaboration hub\n- Reinforcement that the platform is an integral part of the organization's infrastructure\n\nThe proposed custom branding enhancements include the following capabilities.\n\n## Add your company logo\n\nCustomize your experience by adding a company logo which will appear in the header of the login screen and the header of the main application.\n\n[Image of company logo customization]\n\nYou can also add a favicon that will customize the icon that appears in your web browser.\n\n[Image of favicon customization]\n\n### Create branded themes\n\nRather than relying on end-users to create their own custom themes, organizations can create custom themes that will be available to their user base to leverage. Theme defaults can also be set to ensure a consistent experience for all users in the system.\n\n[Image of branded themes]\n\n## Leverage more customizations for the login screen\n\nIn addition to the login page customizations you can already do, we're looking at adding:\n\n- Customized titles\n- Customized colors for backgrounds, text and buttons\n- Custom background image\n\n[Image of login screen customizations]\n\n### What do you think?\n\nWe'd love to know what you think about this proposal. If you're an enterprise customer who wants greater customization in your Mattermost instance, I'd love to chat.

We don't yet have a release target for this feature, but we're gathering feedback on the proposed solution.\n\n## Why a notifications schedule is important\n\nWe all need to be able to disconnect from work, but that can be hard when we're hit with notifications all hours of the day\u2014especially in our remote work culture where we need to establish boundaries between work and home life. This proposed feature gives Mattermost users a way to set personal working hours so they can properly disengage from work during non-work hours. This supports the [right to disconnect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_disconnect).\n\n**NOTE:** this doesn't affect the unread status or the mention badge counts that display in Mattermost, it just silences the desktop and push notifications. When you return to work, you'll still see what you've been mentioned about and the channels that have new unread posts.\n\n## Accessing the notifications schedule\n\nThis feature leverages the \"Do Not Disturb\" status in Mattermost to silence notifications during a specified schedule. The notifications schedule can be accessed from two locations:\n\n  1. From the user account menu under the \"Do not disturb\" submenu.  \n\n  2. The Notifications preferences in the main preferences window.  \n\n## Setting a basic schedule\n\nOnce the notification schedule is enabled, users can select the schedule they want, the start time, and end time that they want notifications to be allowed for. **All notifications will be silenced outside of these set hours** when the notification schedule is enabled.\n\nUsers can choose a schedule that is set for every day, weekdays, or a custom schedule.\n\n## Setting a custom schedule\n\nWhen a custom schedule is chosen, a start and end time for each day of the week is displayed. Days of the week can be disabled if you don't want to include them in the schedule (which means you don't want to be notified on those days).\n\n## Share your feedback\n\nThat's a quick preview of the feature. As we iterate on this solution, we'd love to get feedback from our community and our customers. Let us know what you think by replying to this post!",

There's some remaining bottlenecks that we're posting here about to connect with experts able to advise.\n\n## 1 - Scaling Mattermost for MS Teams connected experience with a per user subscription and rich notifications\n\nIn organizations where every user has access to MS Teams, but some users prefer to use Mattermost, keeping both clients open creates a \"swivel-chair\" effect. The [MS Teams plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-msteams-sync) is an extension to [Mattermost](https://github.com/mattermost) that syncs chats bidirectionally between platforms, allowing users to stay in the platform of their choice while remaining connected to the entire organization.\n\n**Current Architecture**\n\nThe plugin maintains a single, global [/chats](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/chat?view=graph-rest-1.0) subscription to MS Teams. On each [change notification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/change-notifications-api-overview) for a chat message, the plugin attempts to [get chatMessage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/chatmessage-get?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http) using a [delegated access token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-v2-user) for one of the members of the chat. Messages sent from Mattermost use the same delegated access token to [create a chat](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/chat-post) and [send a chat message](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/chat-post-messages).\n\n**Limitations**\n\nA high volume of change notifications results in a high volume of API requests. Rich notifications would avoid the API requests, but unnecessarily include the contents of all chats.\n\n**Proposed Architecture**\n\nThe plugin shall maintain a [/users/{id}/chats/getAllMessages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/chat?view=graph-rest-1.0) subscription to MS Teams for each connected user. Each subscription shall be configured to receive [rich notifications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/change-notifications-with-resource-data) (generating a unique public key per subscription) and allowing the application to directly access the contents of the message without further [get chatMessage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/chatmessage-get?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http) calls.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nA [per-organization limit of 10,000 total subscriptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/change-notifications-api-overview) limits the potential deployment size. Duplicate change notifications (for each member in a chat) also adds processing overhead. Finally, overall API usage may also induce rate limiting for a high volume of active users.\n\n### Seeking Feedback on Scaling Mattermost for MS Teams connected experience:\n\nWe are seeking feedback on whether the proposed architecture is a viable approach, specifically the impact of the per-organization limit of 10,000 total subscriptions, and if there are alternative approaches to scaling this solution for MS Teams that better meets this limitation.\n\n## 2 - Mattermost for MS Teams embedded experience with an MS Teams App\n\nIn environments where access to the full Microsoft Graph API is restricted, Mattermost can be [embedded](https://docs.mattermost.com/about/mattermost-for-microsoft-teams.html#embed-mattermost-within-mattermost-teams) as an app directly accessible from the Teams sidebar.\n\n**Current Architecture**\n\nMS Teams effectively acts as a parent window to Mattermost in an iframe. The user must authenticate directly to Mattermost, after which they can largely use the application unimpeded.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nMattermost doesn't remain active when the user uses other features in MS Teams, nor has a way to relay notifications to the user even when actively using the embedded experience.\n\n**Proposed Architecture**\n\nThe embedded experience shall be extended with application credentials that allows Mattermost to enumerate all MS Teams users and map them by email address to existing Mattermost users. A new account settings option allows Mattermost users to configure MS Teams as their primary platform, after which any notifications are relayed to MS Teams via [activity feed notifications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/send-activity-feed-notification). Finally, support for SSO via MS Teams simplifies authentication and onboarding.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nA consent flow per user is required to allow the app to use the activity feed, unless the Azure administrator regularly accepts that consent on behalf of all new users.\n\n### Seeking Feedback on Mattermost for MS Teams embedded experience:\n\nWe are seeking feedback on whether the proposed architecture is a viable approach, specifically if there are other MS Teams apps that use the activity feed to notify users on MS Teams about new updates, or if there are alternative recommendations that the community recommends.",

I will be sure to share this feedback with the rest of the team for you.\n\nThe Mattermost in-app marketplace is designed to display plugins that are officially supported and maintained by Mattermost Inc., to provide users with a curated, high-quality selection of plugins. This is why the number is currently limited compared to the full list on api.integrations.mattermost.com. I believe the team designed it this way to provide users with a more manageable selection and guarantee a certain level of quality and official support.\n\nThat said, I feel the demand for a wider array of plugins. Mattermosters who wish to install additional plugins not listed in the in-app marketplace can download them directly from the Mattermost Integrations Directory at https://api.integrations.mattermost.com and then upload the plugins to their Mattermost server via the System Console.\n\nFor the specific question about the Nextcloud plugin, this plugin is not directly maintained by Mattermost, and therefore, is not listed in the built-in marketplace. However, you can still install it manually. Please follow this guide on how to install plugins manually: [Redirect](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/plugins.html#plugin-uploads)\n\nWe appreciate your feedback, and it will definitely be taken into account as we continue to develop and improve our platform. If there are specific plugins you'd like to see included in the in-app marketplace, feel free to mention them and we can investigate the feasibility.\n\nDon't hesitate to reach out if you have further questions!\n\nBest,\n~John",

It feels much more like IRC and highly optimized text messaging systems now - which is a very good thing.\n\nOne problem I have noticed is that it can, however, lead to confusion when colorization is not sufficiently contrasty between users. We have noticed that users tend to be colored similar all too often. This leads to difficult differentiation and has caused some communicative mistakes and mis-assigning trains of thought.\n\nIt would be helpful to perhaps do a few things:\n\n  1. allow users to create their own color palettes or assignments for users.\n  2. allow holistic server colorization assignments.\n  3. allow users to assign their preferred color.\n  4. implement an algorithm in Mattermost to choose, by default higher contrast differentiation in channel palettes so as to maximized differentiation insomuch as is possible until there are simply too many users to perform such.\n\nI personally would like to see an organization-based colorization so that all members of certain organizations could be colorized in a similar fashion. This would, however, introduce a new variable/value for profiles that would be \"organization\" or some such associative element for users. I don't think team-based association is enough since many same-org folks are in the same teams\u2026 BUT having an organization assignment could resolve that for this need.\n\nHaving an organizational association in a profile could also open Mattermost up to other interesting features such as viewing messages in a search or other such flat-file listing that is not now really possible, but could show different views into data and perspectives, etc\u2026\n\nAnyway, I do think some level of color control would be very helpful and I appreciate the effort to move down this more concise road!",

However, I can understand how this feature may be beneficial for you and potentially to other users as well. I encourage you to open a feature request on the [Mattermost UserVoice page](https://mattermost.uservoice.com/forums/306457-general) to express your interest in this potential addition. This is a great platform for our developers to see what features are most requested by our users and to plan their work accordingly.\n\nIn the meantime, as a workaround, you might consider using a global proxy setting for your OS, though the effectiveness would depend on your specific networking configuration and system administration.\n\nShould you have any further questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

We are able to access the chat app safely and securely without needing to have Mattermost exposed to the internet at all, using an OpenZiti overaly network (also self-hostable).\n\nAnyway, I was on the community server talking to a MM person and they recommend I toss this idea out into this feedback forum for input.\n\nThe idea would be to embed zero trust directly into Mattermost, making it capable of being accessed from anywhere securely but through application embedded zero trust (there would be no need for some kind of proxying port or 'agent' as is always the case). You'd just download Mattermost, **optionally** join it to an OpenZiti overlay network and you'd be off an running.\n\nI'm happy to discuss the idea here if there's any interest. I know selfishly, I'd love to be able to have our own Mattermost instance protected by end to end encryption and know exactly who is able to access the server in this way.\n\nI'm wondering if there are any other security-conscious people out there that think this is a good (or bad) idea.\n\nThanks!",

While Mattermost doesn't have a built-in feature for animated icons or specific indicators for escalation channels, there are a few alternative approaches you can consider:\n\n1. Channel Naming Convention: You can establish a naming convention for escalation channels, such as prefixing the channel name with \"[Escalation]\" or using specific keywords. This way, users can quickly identify which channels are related to escalations.\n2. Channel Topic: Utilize the channel topic to provide a brief description or status update for the escalation channels. You can update the topic to reflect the current state of the escalation, such as \"URGENT - Escalation in progress\" or \"RESOLVED - Escalation completed.\"\n3. Channel Header Messages: Consider using the Channel Header plugin to display important information or status updates at the top of the channel. You can use this to provide a visual indication or message specific to escalation channels.\n\nThese approaches can help users quickly identify escalation channels and understand their status. Additionally, you can customize the Mattermost interface by developing custom plugins or using the Mattermost API to create more advanced features or visual indicators.\n\nI hope this helps!

Kernel logs indicated an issue with a syscall:\n\n[kernel log details]\n\nIt seems starting with `7.9.0`, Mattermost needs the @resources system call set. Modifying my unit accordingly solved the issue:\n\n[systemd unit modification details]\n\nNow\u2026 I do realize that sandboxing features are very likely nothing you currently test for, when releasing Mattermost. That being said, I was wondering whether this could somehow be made part of your internal testing, as, from a technical perspective, this was a change that has not been mentioned in the changelogs.\n\nI haven't yet seen a software doing that, so Mattermost is in good company there.\n\nBut maybe Mattermost wants to lead by example here, so I'd like you to consider making this part of the changelog in the future.\n\nHaving spent a few minutes thinking about that, I'm fairly certain it should be trivial to make this part of an automated testing pipeline.\n\nSince I assume that usually a Mattermost developer does not go about his/her daily business and suddenly decides \"Well, today I'm gonna introduce a new system call to Mattermost\", I think this is usually introduced by using some **Go** functionality that has not been used before, thus requiring a new set of system calls without the developer necessarily being aware of that.\n\nWell\u2026 that's it for my first post here :slight_smile: Happy to hear some feedback from people running or building Mattermost.\n\nCheers\nThomas",
