This has led to a less-than-ideal experience during the quarterly true-up.\n\nFurthermore, the feature was designed to:\n\n- be only visible during the quarterly true-up period\n- hide the functionality after the data has been sent\n\nWhile the design is not an issue by itself, any errors after the data has been sent cannot be recovered (e.g. administrators cannot re-send the data if not received by Mattermost).\n\nWill this functionality be replaced?\n\nAs of writing, we are currently in the early stages of designing a replacement that aims to not only remove the need for screenshots, but improves the entire quarterly true-up process altogether.\n\nIf you're interested in sharing your thoughts to shape the design & development of the solution, please contact your Customer Success Manager.",

                "message_content": "Mattermost is committed to continuously improving our products to serve our customers' evolving needs. As part of this commitment, we want to inform you about some upcoming product changes that will affect our platform.\n\nEffective September 15th, 2023, Mattermost Boards will transition to being fully community supported, with various other plugins following suit (see full list below). Mattermost will continue to actively maintain a select number of plugins, including Jira, Github, Gitlab, MS Teams Sync plugin, Calls, ServiceNow, and Zoom.\n\nThe reason behind these changes is to focus our resources on improving the platform's performance and core features, which are critical for our community and Enterprise customers.\n\nWe understand that any directional change to a product may have an impact on your existing workflows and processes. Transparency is of utmost importance to us. Our team is ready to assist you and provide the necessary resources to minimize disruptions and help you leverage alternative solutions.\n\nFAQ:\n\nHow will these changes affect my Mattermost instance?\n\n- Mattermost Self-hosted: You may continue to use Boards (Focalboard plugin) and any other plugins without interruption. Moving forward, Mattermost will not be adding features or fixing bugs in community supported plugins beyond September 15th, 2023.\n\n- Mattermost Cloud: Mattermost Boards will be removed from all cloud instances on September 28th, 2023. It is recommended that you export your Boards prior to this date (see below instructions). Other community supported plugins will remain functional; however, it's important to be transparent about the possibility of needing to take down a plugin quickly and with short notice if it presents security or performance issues in our cloud environments.\n\nHow do I export my Boards data?\n\n- You can export your boards to CSV files. To do this, select the options menu (\u2026) to the left of the New button at the top of the board, then select Export to CSV. The CSV will contain all the cards in that board and their associated properties. Learn more in our docs.\n- If you're missing cards in your CSV export, you may have a search query that's filtering items in the board. Try clearing your search and exporting to CSV again.\n\nWhat does \"community supported\" mean?\n\n- Mattermost will no longer be maintaining these plugins - this includes bug fixes and feature additions. Instead, the plugins are open-sourced and made available indefinitely for community contributions in GitHub (repository links below).\n\nWhich plugins are going to be community supported moving forward?\n\n[List of plugins omitted for brevity]\n\nHow do I know what plugins my instance is using?\n\n- As a System Admin, go to System Console > Plugins > Plugin Management to review the status of all plugins installed on your Mattermost deployment.\n- You will see a list of plugin versions currently in use, and can enable or disable plugins here.\n- For example, if you don't see an entry for Mattermost Boards (focalboard - 7.11.2) in the list of plugins, this means that the plugin isn't installed.\n\nWhat should I do if I have a feature request or bug report for Focalboard or other community supported plugins?\n\n- We encourage the community to fork any repository for their own continued development and contributions.\n\nHow do I install new plugins or update existing plugins?\n\n- If a newer version of a plugin is available or to install a new plugin, you can download the plugin package from the associated GitHub repository and then upload it in the System Console > Plugins > Plugin Management page.\n- We recommend \"watching\" and starring the GitHub repositories of the plugins you use to receive notifications when a new release is available to download.\n\nWhat should I do if I have concerns or further questions?\n\n- You can engage with our product team via email at product@mattermost.com",

The Mattermost team is working on releasing a fix scheduled for the v9.0 (September 15) release, as well as subsequent v8.0 dot release and for supported ESR versions. Moving forward, the GIF picker will be powered by GIPHY.\n\nWill I no longer be able to use GIFs in Mattermost?\n\nIf you use GIFs in Mattermost using the in-product GIF picker, users will not see any GIFs starting September 1 until your Mattermost instance is upgraded to v9.0 or subsequent v8.0 dot release. If you're on a supported ESR version, a dot release will be available that you can upgrade to.\n\nIf you use GIFs in Mattermost via the plugin, you can continue without interruption if it is powered by GIPHY or Tenor.\n\nGIFs are important to us. How do we minimize the impact of this shutdown?\n\nWe recommend upgrading to the v9.0 or v8.0 subsequent dot release or an ESR dot release as soon as it is available.\n\nWe understand that GIFs are an integral part of users' ability to express themselves and communicate with colleagues. As such, the GIF plugin is also available.",

If your organization still wishes to host Mattermost on a public cloud, you can deploy Mattermost's open source edition and only pay the cost of hosting. For example, hosting on Azure cloud starts at $18.60 per month.\n\n  * Upgrade to a Professional or Enterprise plan. If Mattermost is a critical tool for your organization, we recommend upgrading. Additional features will be available, including administration and user management, security features, and more.\n\n  * Host Mattermost on your own infrastructure. Did you know you can host Mattermost on your own server? Thousands of organizations self-host Mattermost for increased control, meet nation-state level security requirements and more.
