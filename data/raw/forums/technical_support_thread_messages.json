For example `/code` creates nothing when sending the message, but does eventually show up on a page refresh as expected. Something like `/settings` creates a pop-up right away though.\n\nI've been integrating an existing GitLab install as well and using the out-of-the-box GitLab plugin that comes with the version of Mattermost I installed. Running `/gitlab connect` just does nothing, but I was able to connect my account using the GitLab icon on the sidebar which created a separate login window to use. Something like `/gitlab me` also just does nothing onscreen, but `/gitlab subscription add some/project` works and I can see the subscription in the sidebar when the page is refreshed with whatever features I indicated. Upon connecting my account the plugin bot dumped the help message, but `/gitlab help` never recreates this message. Unlike with the built-in commands, the plugin messages do not show up on refresh.\n\n**Observed behavior**\nThere don't seem to be any relevant errors to draw from, the commands just seem to execute and then nothing happens. At one point I had a typo in a URL for a custom GitLab command which created errors when using it, but those disappeared once the typo was corrected. The only evidence I could see of these commands in the logs is a debug message saying that a command was executed when using the custom GitLab command.\n\nSorry, I know this isn't a whole lot to go on. The majority of my issues are with the GitLab integration, but the builtins were acting oddly enough for me to want to see if there was any insight on a potential wider issue before going to the plugin team directly.

Thanks for reaching out, and welcome to the Mattermost Community forums!\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing issues with push notifications on the Mattermost mobile app. While I'm an AI bot and cannot directly resolve bugs or provide official support, I can offer some suggestions to help you troubleshoot the problem:\n\n  1. Check your notification settings: Ensure that push notifications are enabled for the Mattermost app on your device. You can usually find these settings in the device's system settings or within the app itself.\n  2. Clear the app cache: Clearing the cache of the Mattermost app can sometimes resolve issues. Try clearing the cache and restarting the app to see if it improves the push notification functionality.\n  3. Reinstall the app: If clearing the cache doesn't help, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling the Mattermost app. This can help resolve any corrupted files or settings that might be causing the issue.\n  4. Reach out to Mattermost support: If the issue persists, it's best to reach out to Mattermost support directly. They have the expertise to diagnose and address app-specific issues. You can contact them through the official Mattermost support channels, such as their website or support email.\n\nRemember to provide as much detail as possible about your device, OS version, and steps to reproduce the issue when contacting support. This will help them investigate and resolve the problem more efficiently.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck in resolving the push notification issue!\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance!\n\nBest regards,  \n~Matterbot 2.0 :robot:\n\n[Disclaimer: This is a new AI response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

The toggle should be in the off position.\n  3. **Restart iPhone:-** A simple restart can often resolve temporary software glitches that might be causing the issue. The method for restarting depends on your iPhone model. You can find specific instructions by searching online for \"force restart iPhone [your model]\".\n  4. **Reset Network Settings:-** This will reset your Wi-Fi networks and passwords, Bluetooth connections, cellular settings, and VPN configurations. Go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. You'll need to enter your passcode or use Face ID/Touch ID to confirm.\n  5. **Update iOS:-** An outdated iOS version might have bugs affecting Airplane Mode. Connect your iPhone to Wi-Fi, go to Settings > General > Software Update and see if an update is available.\n  6. **Remove and Reinsert SIM Card:-** Turn off your iPhone, remove the SIM card using the SIM ejector tool, and then put it back in securely. Restart your iPhone and see if Airplane Mode works now.\n\nIf you have problem persist after trying these step. follow for more instruction below.\n\n[Link to YouTube video]",

Create an additional super-admin user (with a username not used in your Slack accounts that you will be importing).\n\n\n\nTo do this use the mmctl tool from Mattermost.  \n**Here are the two commands:**  \n`mmctl auth login https://yourmattermostinstance.com`\n\n`mmctl user create --email whateveremail@whatever.com --username yournewusername --password thepasswordfortheuser --system-admin`\n\n  4. Setup Email Functionality in your Mattermost Instance\n  5. Create a Mattermost workspace with an identical name to your old Slack workspace\n  6. Import your Slack backup:\n\n\n\n`mmctl import upload your-exported-file-from-slack.zip`\n\n`mmctl import list available`  \n(_note the new zip file name_)\n\n`mmctl import process` [inset the name from above step]\n\nAt this point your account is nerfed.

In the mm-instance (1), however, there are system-bot users and bots. So somehow something didn't work during the data migration, I guess. By the way, I did not create the system-bot.\n\nNow I wanted to create the bot manually in the mm-instance (2) with the mmctl-cli and used the command \"user convert --bot\", which was obviously a mistake, because now the system-bot bot exists but no longer the corresponding user. The error message has not disappeared either.\n\nNow my question is: How can I restore the system-bot user and fix the error message in the server logs? Or can I simply delete the system-bot bot? Or have I broken the instance completely (I hope not)?\n\nVersion Mattermost Team Edition (both instances): 9.9.0\nVersion PostgreSQL (both instances): 13.12\n\nThank you very much for your help!",

Upon reviewing the release notes for version 9.9.0, we noticed a **ERROR_SAFE_LIMITS_EXCEEDED** for instances with more than 5000 users. We need to know if Mattermost counts both activated and deactivated users towards the total user count, to ensure we do not encounter the same warning as we did when upgrading to version 9.8.0.\n\n**Observed Behavior**  \nWhile upgrading to version 9.8.0, we received a warning signal in our Mattermost Teams Edition where the message count exceeds 5 million( which in our case exceeded 10+ million though), which got removed after upgrading to 9.8.1 security release.

I don't see it defined as a prerequisite in the documentation, and it is not created during installation, yet it seems to be required for the bulk importer to function.\n\n3rd run: (after creating \"mattermost_test\" database in postgresql)\n\npostgres=# CREATE DATABASE mattermost_test;\n\n> Error importing channel. Team with name \"CihcB\" could not be found., resource: Team id: name=CihcB\n\nI think I have followed the steps in the documentation (after many attempts). I do have a team called \"CihcB\" in the new mattermost instance, however since the bulk import tool is targeting \"mattermost_test\", which is just an empty database and not the production database, there are no teams.\nI'm aware that the documentation says you should run the bulk import command as the mattermost user, however when I try \"su mattermost\" I am unable to change user. I can switch to any other user, but not mattermost. I tried resetting the password for the mattermost user and logging in to the terminal as mattermost, but it doesn't work. Although I don't think running the bulk import command as root is causing me issues so far.\nI have attempted using the mmctl command to bulk upload, but it refused to upload the .zip saying it was too big (369MB).\nI have attempted following the documentation to create the mattermost database before installing Mattermost, which setup PostgreSQL 16; but Mattermost Omnibus includes PostgreSQL 13 as part of the installation regardless of whether there is already a database running.\nI am aware that there is a turnkey Linux container template for Mattermost in Proxmox, although when I tried it I ran into various undocumented problems.\nI'm sorry for the verbosity of my post(!)",

I've got it working on our internal networks, but not remotely.\n\nOur instance is on Mattermost version 9.5.6, running in Docker using nginx, and we have another reverse proxy in front of the host the service runs on. In order to get around having to route UDP traffic through the reverse proxy, we have a public IP that forwards all TCP and UDP traffic on port 8443 straight to the host, where said ports are exposed from the Mattermost container. This public IP is set as the ICE host override in the Calls plugin settings.\n\nTrying to start a call on a device connected to the workplace network or VPN works perfectly fine, and running a tcpdump shows constant requests back and forth between the Mattermost container and the client device. However, on a device outside the network, the call times out after a few seconds.

What I'm really wondering here is if this is intended behavior or not. If so, this makes it unnecessarily difficult for our employees who work remotely to make use of this feature. We'd really like to not force them to use a VPN or change the settings on their private network setup to forward this kind of traffic to their devices.\n\nRegards,\nThomas",

Here are some common steps and tips to troubleshoot mobile app issues on both Android and iOS platforms:\n\n### General Steps\n\n1. **Restart the App**:\n   * Close the app completely and reopen it.\n   * On Android: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (or tap the recent apps button) and swipe the app away.\n   * On iOS: Double-tap the home button or swipe up from the bottom (iPhone X and later) to access the app switcher and swipe the app away.\n\n2. **Restart the Device**:\n   * Turn off your device and turn it back on. This can resolve many minor software glitches.\n\n3. **Check for Updates**:\n   * Ensure both the app and your device's operating system are up to date.\n   * On Android: Open Google Play Store > Menu > My apps & games > Update.\n   * On iOS: Open App Store > Today > Profile icon > Update All.\n\n4. **Check Internet Connection**:\n   * Ensure you have a stable internet connection.\n   * Try switching between Wi-Fi and mobile data.\n\n5. **Clear Cache and Data** (Android only):\n   * Go to Settings > Apps > Select the app > Storage > Clear Cache (and Clear Data if necessary).\n\n6. **Reinstall the App**:\n   * Delete the app and reinstall it from the app store.\n   * Ensure you have your login information saved as reinstalling may log you out.\n\n### Platform-Specific Tips\n\n#### Android\n\n1. **Check App Permissions**:\n   * Go to Settings > Apps > Select the app > Permissions.\n   * Ensure the app has the necessary permissions to function correctly.\n\n2. **Check Battery Optimization Settings**:\n   * Go to Settings > Battery > Battery optimization > Select the app > Don't optimize.\n   * Some apps may not work properly when battery optimization is enabled.\n\n3. **Safe Mode**:\n   * Restart your device in Safe Mode to see if a third-party app is causing the issue.\n   * Hold the power button > Tap and hold Power off > Reboot to Safe Mode.\n\n#### iOS\n\n1. **Check Background App Refresh**:\n   * Go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh.\n   * Ensure the app is allowed to refresh in the background.\n\n2. **Reset Network Settings**:\n   * Go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings.\n   * Note that this will erase all saved Wi-Fi passwords.\n\n3. **Check for App Crashes and Logs**:\n   * Go to Settings > Privacy > Analytics & Improvements > Analytics Data.\n   * Look for entries related to the app in question.\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n1. **App Crashing or Freezing**:\n   * Restart the app and device.\n   * Clear cache and data (Android).\n   * Check for updates.\n\n2. **App Not Opening**:\n   * Check internet connection.\n   * Update the app and OS.\n   * Reinstall the app.\n\n3. **App Running Slowly**:\n   * Clear cache.\n   * Check for background processes consuming resources.\n   * Free up storage space.\n\n4. **Login Issues**:\n   * Ensure correct login credentials.\n   * Reset password if necessary.\n   * Check server status of the app.\n\n5. **Notification Problems**:\n   * Ensure notifications are enabled in both the app settings and device settings.\n   * Check Do Not Disturb mode.\n   * Restart the device.\n\n### Advanced Troubleshooting\n\n1. **Check for Known Issues**:\n   * Visit the app's official support page or forums for known bugs and fixes.\n\n2. **Developer Options (Android)**:\n   * Enable Developer Options by going to Settings > About phone > Tap on Build number 7 times.\n   * Use debugging tools to gather more information on the issue.\n\n3. **Contact Support**:\n   * If all else fails, contact the app's customer support with detailed information about the issue.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve most common issues with mobile apps. If the problem persists, it might be a more complex issue that requires professional support or a bug that the app developers need to address.",

Check Automatic Update Settings:-** Make sure both \"Download iOS Updates\" and \"Install iOS Updates\" are enabled in Settings > General > Software Update > Automatic Updates.\n**2. Restart Your iPhone:-** A simple restart can sometimes clear up software glitches. Restart your iPhone, then check for updates again.\n**3. Delete and Retry the Update Download:-** If the update download seems stuck, try deleting it and downloading it again. Go to Settings > General > [Device name] Storage, find the update in the list, and tap \"Delete Update\". Then go back to Software Update and try downloading again.\n**4. Check Storage Space:-** Your iPhone might not have enough space to download the update. Try deleting unused apps or files to free up space.\n**5. Check Wi-Fi Connection:-** Make sure your iPhone is connected to a strong and stable Wi-Fi network.\nMore details instruction below.\n\n[ ![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/1afcSx1anEY/maxresdefault.jpg) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1afcSx1anEY)",

We are very sensitive about visual design, unsurprisingly\u2026 You could call us design snobs, yes. Mattermost's interface is very well though-out and functional. But (at least to me) also feels a tiny bit too technical, blocky, crowded, heavy. I really would like to tweak the default appearance. Make it a bit lighter, more whitespace, reduce weight of or even hide some elements, etc.\n\nI am working on concepts and visual design for screen interfaces for 15+ years. So I know what I do. \ud83d\ude42 This might even lead to some contributions to the Mattermost design in the long run.\n\nAny ideas?",

(For example, the email address that you have verified through SendGrid is likely any other email address other than, in our example, `mattermost@demo.com`)\n\nTo fix this, you either need to change the email address that your Mattermost server sends the emails from to match the email address you have verified in SendGrid, or you need to create another verified email address in your SendGrid account, that is the same email address that Is currently configured to be the `send address` in your Mattermost server.\n\nI hope that helps, and please let me know if you experience any further troubles!",

I found some nuances in the database that could trip up anyone trying to reproduce this if they're not careful.\n\nThe first big red flag is that there are some users in our database that have no record in the `status` table. 4.62% of my users (both active and deleted) fall into this camp. It's not clear to me why this should be possible, or what it signifies. My best guess is that these are users who successfully created an account but never actually logged in, but that's based entirely on speculation. The implication is that a simple JOIN of the `user` and `status` tables doesn't give you a complete picture of user activity, as it would leave these users out of the result. I chose to work around these by considering `user.updateat` if the user had no row in the `status` table.\n\nThe second red flag is that `user.updateat` can be newer than the corresponding `status.lastactivityat` value. This is more speculation, but I suspect this indicates login activity without new posts. If you wanted 'idleness' to be reset by any activity at all, then you need to consider this value as well.\n\nSince I was writing a bunch of python to do all the work for this anyway, the simplest solution for me was to collect the data I need using two separate queries of the database, merge the result into a Python structure for decision-making, and then do all of the deactivation work through the API.\n\nThese are my two queries:\n\nSELECT\n    users.id,\n    users.username, \n    users.firstname, \n    users.lastname, \n    users.email,\n    (users.createat/1000) AS created, \n    (users.updateat/1000) AS updated\nFROM\n    users\nWHERE\n    users.deleteat = 0\nORDER BY users.username;\n\n\nSELECT\n    users.id,\n    (status.lastactivityat/1000) AS lastactivity\nFROM\n    users, status\nWHERE\n    users.deleteat = 0 AND\n    status.userid = users.id\nORDER BY users.username;\n\nI then merged those results into instances of a custom Python class `User` with instance variables for each of the important datapoints. The database stores date values as milliseconds since unix epoch (Jan 1 1970 00:00:00 UTC), and the queries above convert these to seconds.  \nTo check idleness, generate a reasonable epoch value for your idle threshold and do simple numeric comparisons. A rough sketch in python of making the 'idle' decision looks like this:\n\ndef user_is_idle(user: User, idle_weeks: int) -> bool:\n   now = datetime.now(tz=UTC)\n   then = now - timedelta(weeks=idle_weeks)\n   # cast the result into epoch seconds\n   threshold = int(then.strftime(\"%s\")) \n\n   if user.last_activity and user.last_activity > user.updated:\n      # user has a status.lastactivityat and it's the most recent \n      # timestamp\n      key_value = user.last_activity\n   else:\n      # either the user has no `status` row, or `status.lastactivityat`\n      # is older than `user.updateat`\n      key_value = user.updated\n\n   return key_value < threshold\n\nThe rest is a matter of either using the API or `mmctl` to delete the idle users. I would go this route rather than directly modifying the db for safety reasons. Using supported methods for modifying users ensures that you can't miss steps or corrupt your data due to your own errors \u2026 anything that goes wrong at that point should be a reportable bug in Mattermost itself.",

                "message_content": "**Summary**\nI want to disable Threads, because I find them cumbersome.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\nUse the _browser_ to access MM (as opposed to the desktop/mobile app). Have someone _reply_ to something you wrote (by hitting _Reply_ , as opposed to just writing something in a new line). Stay in the channel where you were, and try to actually read the reply, _without**at least** one more mouse click_. FAIL.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nI expect to see the reply _immediately_ , without an additional one or even two (if you prefer having the actual content you are interested in _**not**_ squeezed into a slim frame at the far right edge of my monitor) mouse clicks, just like I could in MM 7.x and earlier.\n\n**Observed behavior**\nIf someone uses _Reply_ , the actual reply is not immediately visible. I have to click on another GUI element to be able to read the reply, which is then presented in the (very slim) right sidebar at the edge of my monitor. Even if I click _Expand sidebar_ (or hit `Ctrl+Shift+.`), the sidebar still only gets extended to the middle of my monitor. So, half of the available screen real estate is effectively wasted.\n\nMessages and replies are the _**central**_ component of any chat system. Why do they get exiled (at least partially) to the _**side** bar_? What's the reasoning behind keeping only the initial message in the central view, and moving replies to the sidebar? More often than not, replies tend to be much longer than the inital message.\n\nExamples: _Q. Can someone explain the Theory of relativity?_ , _Q. How do Quantum physics actually work?_ , _Q. What's this newfangled \"AI\" thing that everybody is talking about?_ , and so on (okay, so these are \"slightly\" exaggerated examples, but you get my point). So you keep one small sentence in the (visually) large central area, and then force-cram potentially multiple pages of text (in case someone decides to copy/paste a whole Wikipedia page instead of just posting a link) into a much smaller area of the screen. That seems a bit counter-intuitive to me, no?\n\nSo, my actual question is: how can I disable (or toggle on/off on demand) MM's threading feature, so I can read replies immediately without having to jump through additional hoops? I didn't find anything in `config.json` or in the online docs.\n\nThanks!",

Your point of view is interesting and we definitely understand where you're coming from.\n\nCurrently, the thread functionality is built into the structure of Mattermost and isn't something that can be disabled on demand. The rationale behind this design was to allow users to follow multiple conversations in a single channel without losing context.\n\nHowever, we're committed to improving and evolving the user interface and user experience in Mattermost based on our users' needs and feedback. Your insights into how threads are utilized in your workflow are valuable, and I assure you that they will be considered as we plan changes to the platform.\n\nIn the meantime, unfortunately, there isn't a way to avoid the extra click when using replies in the browser version.\n\nI understand this isn't the ideal solution for your issue, but your feedback definitely helps us see things from a different perspective and informs our future product enhancements. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you - rest assured, our team is always working on making the Mattermost experience better.\n\nOnce again, I appreciate your engagement and your suggestions.

Currently, in order to reply to someone a few messages back, you hit the reply button and it goes into a thread. Alternatively, mattermost could add a quote button on messages next to the reply button. When you click the quote button, the contents of the first few lines of the message go into your input box inside a quote, followed by elipsis if there is more. You can then type your response and people will know who you are talking to.\n\nThis way thread users can use thread, but thread dislikers can have the option to not use them without having to manually copy and paste and add a quote at the beginning of their message.",

Azure AD) tenant.\n  * Follow the steps at [How to integrate Mattermost E20 with Office 365](https://mattermost.com/blog/how-to-integrate-mattermost-e20-with-office-365/) to allow users from the Entra ID tenant to log in to Mattermost\n  * Log in to MM and join a team\n  * Check out your user profile and notice that it only has a username (the part of the login UPN; in our case it's a random identifier that has no resemblance of the user's real or nick name)\n  * Try to edit user profile: In User Profile Settings, under FULL NAME, it says \"Click 'edit' to add your full name\" but clicking Edit reveals only \"This field is handled through your login provider. If you want to change it, you need to do so through your login provider.\"\n  * note you can edit your nickname\n  * For other users, you can only see their \"@username\" (e.g. @lrg253lg) and their self-chosen nickname (e.g. \"hobbit\"), but not the \"Full Name\"\n\n\n\nWhen troubleshooting, we observed that the cause is that the identity provider (Entra ID) user profile do not have a \"First\" and \"Last\" name value populated, but only the \"Display Name\" value.\n\nIn a test tenant, we could replicate this and work around it by populating \"First name\" and \"Last name\" values in accounts.\n\nHowever, when first and last name values are set in the identity provider (Entra ID user account properties) and Mattermost config is set to \"Teammate Name Display: show nickname if one exists, otherwise show first and last name\":\n\n  * Yes, we now see the user's nickname prominently displayed in chat for those who have it configured (excellent, that's what we want)\n  * When clicking on the user icon in a chat, the little profile popup only shows \"First name and Last Name\" on top, followed by @1231231 (random account name from IDP), email address, \u2026 but no indication of the nickname.\n\n\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\n  * Higher Pri: Able to map which parts of an O365 (Entra ID) claim compose the \"Full Name\" of a user in Mattermost to avoid making assumptions about which fields contain the correct data used in a given organization.\n  * Optional: Also enable the optional mapping of the \"Position\" user profile setting, e.g. to pull \"job title\".\n  * Optional: display the nickname as part of the mini-profile popup when clicking another user's name in chat\n\n\n\n**Observed behavior**\n\n  * Unable to map the Entra ID / O365 / identity provider user profile property \"Display Name\" to the Mattermost user profile \"Full Name\". Matter most always composes \"Full Name\" by concatenating \"First Name\" and \"Last Name\" from the IDP. This can create problems for certain name use policies, as well as or Mattermost server operators who do not have the power to convince a large organization to change the way they populate their identity fields in Entra ID.",

I have limited knowledge of MySQL, and especially PostgreSQl, but I'm in the process of learning as I go.\n\nPlease look at the below, and if you can help, please let me know what I need to look into, or if there is a fix. I'm quite interested in .load files which I can use with pgloader, to load in each affected area; if I have to go that far.\n\nAt the moment, the real show-stopper is the users panel of the mattermost system console will not show users, due to the affected areas not migrating. Boards are also non-functional, but unused (would still like those working.) Playbooks appears functional, but untested fully. If boards and playbooks can be dropped and rebuilt, I'd like to know the method.\n\n#### Summary\n\nI am in the process of running a test migration for a 9.6.1 installation from MySQL to PostgreSQL, which is resulting in the non-migration of data due to text vs jsonb formatting.\n\nNote: Apologies about this post in advance, I'm very stuck.\n\n#### Steps to reproduce\n\nThis is taking the currently existing installation, which has been upgraded over a fair number of years, following the official migration guide steps verbatim.\n\n#### Expected behavior\n\nI expect the conversion to proceed smoothly, and at the very least perform conversions of text to jsonb as needed.\n\n#### Observed behavior (that appears unintentional)\n\nFollowing the official guide, certain data is unable to be migrated as it is of type text, and not jsonb.\n\n[error messages omitted for brevity]\n\n#### Possible fixes\n\nI need a method by which the problem areas can be fixed, this is well beyond my current knowledge level, and those with expertise should be able to help me. In turn, I believe if this can be fixed, it will provide a pathway for many users in the same situation; as well as improve the migration guide.\n\nNote: I'm mainly interested in directions for performing such a conversion, preferably usable at a beginners level; I will learn, but I need proper direction to do so.\n\nI was able to migrate the posts specifically using the following adjusted load file, found in another issue post, so that is working well enough [this may be of use to you for the official guide]:\n\n[load file code omitted for brevity]",

The error you receive from both the web console and mmctl indicates an issue with the size of the request.\n\nTo address this, you can try adjusting the configuration related to maximum request size in both Nginx and Mattermost.\n\nFor Nginx:\n\n  1. Locate the Nginx configuration file for your Mattermost server.\n  2. Look for the `client_max_body_size` directive.\n  3. Increase the value of `client_max_body_size` to a higher limit, such as `100M` for 100 megabytes.\n  4. Save the configuration file and restart Nginx.\n\n\n\nFor Mattermost:\n\n  1. Access your Mattermost server's Docker container.\n  2. Locate the Mattermost configuration file, which is typically named `config.json`.\n  3. Open the `config.json` file and add or modify the `\"MaximumFileSize\"` setting to increase the maximum allowed file size. For example:\n\n\n    \n    \n    \"FileSettings\": {\n        ...\n        \"MaximumFileSize\": 104857600, // 100 megabytes in bytes\n        ...\n    },\n    \n\n  4. Save the `config.json` file and restart the Mattermost server container.\n\n\n\nAfter applying these changes, try uploading the plugin again using both the web console and mmctl. The increased limits should allow the upload to proceed without encountering the \"Request Entity Too Large\" error.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or encounter any issues during this process!\n\nBest regards,  \n~Matterbot 2.0 ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This is a new AI response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

Specifically, I aim to enable access to the same Mattermost server directly via an internal IP address (`http[s]://192.168.0.200`) and a LAN-specific domain (`http[s]://mattermost.lan`), in addition to the existing external URL.\n\nGiven that the Mattermost `config.json` file allows specifying only a single `SiteURL` (and similarly a single `WebsocketURL`), I'm exploring the best method to achieve this dual-access setup without compromising functionality or user experience.\n\nSome considerations:\n\n  * LAN access can be over HTTP, as it's a highly trusted and very limited local network with a limited number of users. All LAN users are already system admins and it's just a few folks.\n  * I'm using pfSense for DNS and DHCP within the LAN, which gives some flexibility for DNS resolution and routing.\n  * The goal is to maintain seamless user experience regardless of whether access is from within the LAN or over the internet.\n\n\n\nI'd appreciate insights or recommendations on how others have approached a similar scenario.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n  1. Are there recommended practices for configuring Mattermost or the network to handle multiple access URLs like this?\n  2. Is there a preferred method to route LAN requests to the server without needing to modify the `SiteURL` in the Mattermost configuration?\n  3. Has anyone successfully used reverse proxies, specific DNS configurations, or other network solutions to facilitate this kind of setup?\n\n\n\nAppreciate any thoughts on this!",

You have to realize that searching leverages full text indexes which makes it fast. Without using them, the DB will have considerably higher load for no good reason.\n\nUnfortunately, if you are using the DB for search, then installing the tokenizer is your only way. You can see here our documentation for similar languages without space: [Chinese, Japanese and Korean search - Mattermost documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/enabling-chinese-japanese-korean-search.html).

So my first question is about the docs:\n\n> Set `DataSource` to `\"postgres://mmuser:<mmuser-password>@<host-name-or-IP>:5432/mattermost?sslmode=disable&connect_timeout=10\"` replacing `mmuser`, `<mmuser-password>`, `<host-name-or-IP>` and `mattermost` with your database name.\n\nSo just as an example, let's say we have a user `blub` with password `1234` and the DB name is `mattermost`, then is this the right format:\n\n```\n\"postgres://blub:1234@<host-name-or-IP>:5432/mattermost?sslmode=disable&connect_timeout=10\"\n```\n\nIs that correct, or should it be `<1234>`?\n\n2. I was also wondering what to choose as the `<host-name-or-IP>`? Can I get this printed out somehow?\n\n3. It also states in the docs to add amongst others `After=postgresql.service` to the systemd unit file. In my case, the systemd unit file contained `After=network.service`, should I have both, or replace the `After=network.service` by `After=postgresql.service`?\n\nThanks a lot,\nImahn",

I'm here to help you out with your Mattermost installation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.\n\nRegarding your first question about the database configuration, you're on the right track. If you have a user named \"blub\" with password \"1234\" and the database name is \"mattermost,\" the correct format for the DataSource would be:\n\n\"postgres://blub:1234@:5432/mattermost?sslmode=disable&connect_timeout=10\"\n\nSo you don't need to include angle brackets (\"< >\") around the password. Just replace \"\" with the actual hostname or IP address of your PostgreSQL server.\n\nTo find the hostname or IP address of your PostgreSQL server, you can typically use the command:\n\n```\n$ hostname -I\n```\n\nThis will display the IP address of your server. Alternatively, if you know the hostname of your server, you can use that instead.\n\nRegarding the systemd unit file, you should have both \"After=network.service\" and \"After=postgresql.service\" in the file. The \"After=network.service\" directive ensures that the network is up before starting Mattermost, while \"After=postgresql.service\" ensures that PostgreSQL is started before Mattermost.\n\nI hope this helps!

It's not necessary to validate the e-mail addresses, you can force that later on in the database or by using `mmctl`, but you might want to look at the `mmctl` approach directly, because it allows you to bulk add and force validate the e-mail addresses.\n\n`mmctl` is part of the Mattermost server distribution but can also be downloaded independently, but if you have SSH access to your Mattermost server I suggest to enable the `LocalMode` setting in your `config.json` (Section `ServiceSettings`) and restart the server to activate that change.  \nTheny ou can use `mmctl` without additional authentication directly on the server:\n    \n    \n    # /opt/mattermost/bin/mmctl --local user create --help\n    Create a user\n    \n    Usage:\n      mmctl user create [flags]\n    \n    Examples:\n      # You can create a user\n      $ mmctl user create --email user@example.com --username userexample --password Password1\n    \n      # You can define optional fields like first name, last name and nick name too\n      $ mmctl user create --email user@example.com --username userexample --password Password1 --firstname User --lastname Example --nickname userex\n    \n      # Also you can create the user as system administrator\n      $ mmctl user create --email user@example.com --username userexample --password Password1 --system-admin\n    \n      # Finally you can verify user on creation if you have enough permissions\n      $ mmctl user create --email user@example.com --username userexample --password Password1 --system-admin --email-verified",

During development, we've encountered some specific challenges related to the integration of plugins, such as Focalboard and PlayBooks, and the management of cookies across different domains.\n\nInitially, we set up a reverse proxy server using Nginx within our web application to handle the frontend and the Mattermost server on separate instances. However, we faced an issue where the plugins were not displayed in the frontend. We are unsure if this is viable, and if it is, what we would need to configure for them to be displayed.\n\nTo overcome this hurdle, we tried deploying our custom frontend along with the Mattermost instance, placing the compiled code directly in the /mattermost/client path of our Mattermost server instance. When we navigate to the domain of the Mattermost server, our frontend is displayed correctly. However, when accessing Mattermost through our backend (located on a different domain), the cookies were set under this latter domain. This resulted in the requests made by the plugins not including the necessary cookies, since they were pointing to the domain of the webapp, which is the same as that of the Mattermost server, preventing the plugin requests from completing correctly.\n\nWe are looking for advice or solutions that would allow us to solve this problem. The questions we are currently asking ourselves, which we don't know if they are the best paths to choose, are:\n\n- Configure the Mattermost instance to serve the webapp through a reverse proxy server. Is this technically possible?\n- Modify the domain to which the plugins send their requests, so that it matches the domain of our backend.\n- Adjust the individual instances of the server and the Mattermost webapp so that the plugins are displayed properly.\n\nIt is important to mention that we are deploying these instances in a Kubernetes environment.\n\nHas anyone faced similar challenges or has experience configuring Mattermost in this way? Any guidance, practical example, or suggestion would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you in advance for your help and we look forward to your responses",

Pull up to try again\". If I then tap the \"i\" to the right of the post and then \"try again\" the message posts successfully.\n\nI'm thinking that this current issue could be related to your issue here where the device doesn't connect once you've logged in (but doesn't give any notification either that you're not connected)",

To help resolve these, could you please provide some additional information? It would be really helpful to know:\n\n  1. The version of Mattermost that you're using.\n  2. The version of the mobile app that you're using.\n  3. The version of Docker being used.\n  4. The cellphone model and its operating system.\n\n\n\nTo start fixing the problems:\n\n  1. \"Server not reachable\" - it's odd that you're seeing this error but still able to send & receive messages. This could be due to your DNS configuration. Would you be able to check whether your DNS is configured correctly?\n\n  2. \"No notifications can be received from your server\" - From the provided config file, it's noticeable the push notification server is set to `https://push-test.mattermost.com/` which is used for testing purposes. Please ensure that your push notification server is properly configured. You can follow the steps given in the [Mattermost Documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/install/config-push-proxy.html) to set up the push notification server.\n\n  3. \"Live URL Test in system console fails\" - This could be related to your Site URL configuration. I noticed that the `SiteURL` field in your `ServiceSettings` is empty. This should be set to the URL at which users access your Mattermost server. This could potentially resolve your first and third issues.\n\n\n\n\nIf you already followed all the steps mentioned and the problems persist, I would recommend looking at the Mattermost logs for any error messages. You can adjust the log level in System Console > Environment > Logging, set to `DEBUG` for getting detailed logs.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to ask if you have any other issues or need further assistance.

The error message you provided indicates a permissions problem, specifically related to the `read_channel_content` permission.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, here are a few steps you can try:\n\n  1. Double-check System Admin permissions: Ensure that the affected users have the \"System Admin\" role assigned to them. You can do this by going to \"System Console\" > \"Users\" > \"Edit\" next to the user's name and verifying the assigned role.\n  2. Review Channel permissions: Check the permissions for the channels where the users are encountering the issue. Make sure that the affected users have the necessary permissions to read channel content. You can adjust channel permissions by going to the channel, clicking on the three-dot menu, selecting \"Manage Members\", and reviewing the permissions for the affected users.\n  3. Check Team permissions: Confirm that the affected users have the necessary permissions within their teams. Go to \"Main Menu\" > \"Teams\" > \"Team Settings\" > \"Manage Members\" and review the permissions for the affected users.\n  4. Clear browser cache: Sometimes, browser cache can cause unexpected issues. Clear your browser cache and try accessing Mattermost again to see if the issue persists.\n  5. Verify database schema: Ensure that the database schema version matches the Mattermost server version. You mentioned that the database schema version is 113, which is correct for Mattermost 8.1.2.\n\n\n\nIf the issue still persists after trying these steps, please provide more details about your deployment, such as:\n\n  * Are you using LDAP or SAML authentication?\n  * Have you made any customizations to the Mattermost server or have any plugins installed?\n  * Did you encounter any errors during the upgrade process?\n\n\n\nThis information will help me assist you further in troubleshooting the problem.\n\nBest regards,  \n~Matterbot 2.0 ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This is a beta AI assisted response powered by ChatGPT.

Let me help clarify the websocket events that relate to your requirements.\n\nFor receiving a notification when a reply is made to a particular post, you'd want to listen to the `posted` websocket event. This event is emitted every time a new post is created, this includes replies to existing posts. The payload includes the `post` object itself which contains the `channel_id` and the `root_id` which is the ID of the original post in case of a reply.\n\nRegarding your question about `response` and `thread_updated` websocket events, currently there's no `response` event. As for `thread_updated`, it gets triggered when a new reply is posted to a thread and you are following that thread. The payload includes the `post` object of the new reply and information about the thread.\n\nThe `plugin_statuses_changed` websocket event is emitted when there's a status change of any plugins, that could be due to enabling/disabling a plugin or installing/uninstalling a plugin. It's not directly tied to playbooks.\n\nDo remember, to receive these websocket events, you'd need to have a websocket connection opened to your Mattermost server, and an active authenticated session.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or need more clarification, I'm here to help.\n\nBest,  \n~Mattermost AI Assistant ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

I've been using Mattermost for many years and recently decided I would finally get away from MySQL and move to Postgres, so I installed the omnibus version and am using mmctl to export data from the older server. But I keep getting an error during the import about 'size limit exceeded.'\n\nI have adjusted nginx and the system console to 20gb to allow more than enough size for the export zip (17gb) so I don't think it's related to that.\n\nThe source server is running 9.4.2 on Mint 21.1 and MySQL 8.0.35. New server is Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS with latest & greatest omnibus ver 9.4.2 & Postgres.\n\nEverything runs perfectly until the import of what appears to be custom emojis. A log snippet:\n\n```\n{\"timestamp\":\"2024-02-05 00:13:25.256 Z\",\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Importing emoji\",\"caller\":\"app/import_functions.go:1949\",\"emoji_name\":\"call\"}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2024-02-05 00:13:25.263 Z\",\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Bulk import worker finished\",\"caller\":\"app/import.go:121\",\"bulk_import_worker_id\":\"dzc9ag5as7bwjknmooxqfkn9ro\",\"processed_lines\":16}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2024-02-05 00:13:25.273 Z\",\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Bulk import worker finished\",\"caller\":\"app/import.go:121\",\"bulk_import_worker_id\":\"pehdkmr543nspxhs4howi71dby\",\"processed_lines\":17}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2024-02-05 00:13:25.273 Z\",\"level\":\"error\",\"msg\":\"SimpleWorker: job execution error\",\"caller\":\"jobs/base_workers.go:96\",\"worker_name\":\"ImportProcess\",\"job_id\":\"ykhpng9pjbf93eue6apnawx5re\",\"job_type\":\"import_process\",\"job_create_at\":\"Feb  5 00:13:01.146\",\"error\":\"WriteFile: Unable to write the file., unable write the data in the file /var/opt/mattermost/data/emoji/1wirbaodqjn8fd9rsbg7szf94y/image: size limit exceeded\"}\n```\n\nI do have a handful of emojis that are greater than 512kb so I'm wondering if that's what's causing this. And if so, should I delete them? I tried exploring the zip to find the files referenced but I don't see the directories or files listed in the log so I am very confused.\n\nI searched pretty extensively and only saw what appeared to be issues related to 'client_max_body_size' which I don't believe is an issue. So I'm hoping someone has a suggestion as to how to work around this. Thanks in advance.",

Mattermost has a restriction for custom emoji uploads and it applies even during import processes. By default, image files for custom emojis must be no larger than 512KB. That's probably the reason why you're unable to see those files in the export as they might have been omitted due to their file size.\n\nNonetheless, here are the steps you can take to circumvent this problem:\n\n1. **Removing Large Emojis:** Since you've observed that some emojis are larger than the allowed size, consider deleting them and then try the import process again.\n\n2. **Increasing the Max File Size**: Another approach could be temporarily increasing the maximum file size for emoji uploads on your new Mattermost instance. Head to `System Console > Environment > File Storage > Maximum File Size` and set a higher value there. After the import is successful, revert the size to its original limitation.\n\n3. **Manual Transfer**: If the above 2 steps do not work, you might want to consider a manual approach where you manually copy your custom emojis over to the new instance. Be aware that this may be a more tedious process and should be considered as a last resort.\n\nRemember to backup your data before making adjustments.\n\nI hope these options helps. If you're still experiencing difficulties, please don't hesitate to let us know so we can continue to assist.

What I discovered is that when I delete an offending emoji it leaves the image in the folder and just seems to rewrite it as 'image_deleted.' But that deleted image retains the original file properties, meaning it still kills the transfer process.\n\nI know from my nearly eight years of Mattermost experience that it's not a good idea to delete files from the server \u2013 even if those files have been deleted within the MM instance, they remain in the /data directories.\n\nAre you confirming that it is safe to physically remove those larger emojis prior to the export on the old system? I have several hundred custom emojis so it'll take some manual work \u2013 but if you think this won't break MM then I will do it. Thanks again.",

It appears that the 'image_deleted' files, even though they remain on the file system as >512k files, are ignored by the export process.",

I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with enabling plugin uploads, but I'm happy to help get this sorted!\n\nIt appears from your screenshots that you have indeed correctly configured Mattermost to allow plugin uploads. However, the problem persists which indicates that there might be a misunderstanding or misconfiguration somewhere.\n\nOne thing to check is the file permission of your `config.json` file in the Docker volume. Make sure that the Mattermost service can read and write to this file. It's also worth making sure that the file changes are properly saved and the Mattermost service is indeed restarted after the changes.\n\nIf this doesn't resolve your issue, the next thing to check would be your system logs. An error message related to plugin uploads should have been logged if something went wrong. The logs could give us a clue about what's happening.\n\nLastly, please make sure that the Mattermost server has network access to download the plugins.\n\nI hope that helps, and please let me know if you're still experiencing the issue.

The platform's main focus is communication and collaboration, and we understand how real-time file editing could enhance your experience.\n\nWhile you cannot overwrite a sent file, you can upload a new version of the file in the conversation thread. In the meantime, for real-time collaborative file editing, we recommend integrating services like Google Drive, Office 365, or other third-party tools compatible with Mattermost.\n\nWe're always eager to improve and expand our feature offerings, so user feedback is greatly appreciated. We'd be glad to take your suggestion into consideration for our roadmap.\n\nAgain, thank you for your insightful query and suggestions.\n\nBest regards,  \n~Mattermost AI Assistant \ud83e\udd16\n\n[Disclaimer: This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

Essentially, `getElementsByClassName` returns an HTML collection, which is an array-like object of all child elements. This means, `courses.textContent` might not work because you're trying to access `textContent` on a collection of elements rather than a single element.\n\nAs such, you would need to loop through or access a specific index of `courses`. Here's a quick example:\n\n`courses = document.getElementsByClassName('gwt-InlineLabel WG5F WF4F'); for (var i = 0; i < courses.length; i++) { console.log(courses[i].textContent); }`\n\nThat way, you could access and manipulate the `textContent` property for each `div` element separately.\n\nDon't hesitate to reply if you have further questions or encounter any issues. We are here to assist you!\n\nKeep up the great work and happy coding! :male-technologist:\n\nBest regards,  \n~Mattermost AI Assistant ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

You can export messages from the System Console if you have administrative rights. Following is the step-by-step guide:\n\n  1. Go to the System Console\n  2. Under `REPORTS` tab, select `Compliance Reports`\n  3. Click `Run Compliance Report`\n  4. Fill out the information including the user's name and the date range you are looking for\n  5. Click `Run`\n\n\n\nThis should export all the chat messages from the user within the specified date range.\n\nPlease be aware that the export feature may be dependent on the license and subscription level of your Mattermost server, and it's also important to respect privacy regulations in the use of this data.\n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance.

You're doing a great job by already being able to authenticate with Mattermost, create posts and channels. We'll get this issue figured out as well.\n\nThe issue you're seeing can be due to several reasons. Here are a few possible causes and their solutions:\n\n1. **Docker Networking**: Sometimes Docker's networking configurations can cause issues with the websocket. Make sure your Docker configuration allows for the websocket to maintain a persistent connection. You might also want to check the network policies associated with your Docker setup.\n\n2. **Reverse Proxy Settings**: If you're using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache, ensure your configurations are allowing websocket connections, and that they're properly configured to proxy them.\n\n3. **Firewall or Security Group rules**: Ensure there's no firewall or security group rule that could be interrupting the websocket connection.\n\nRemember to check your Mattermost server logs for any additional information that could be helpful. If you need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach back out.\n\nWe appreciate your patience in resolving this matter, and we're glad you're part of the Mattermost community!\n\nBest,\n~Mattermost AI Assistant\n\n[Disclaimer: This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

For example, have you verified that your 'maxrecordingduration' isn't too low? It's set to 60, which represents 60 seconds. If your calls are longer than this, you may need to increase this limit.\n\nIf that doesn't resolve your issue, could you please provide a bit more information to assist us in diagnosing the problem further?

It looks like you're encountering a build failure and numerous deprecation warnings in your work with the Mattermost mobile project.\n\nAs a first step, please ensure that your Java version for both 'compileDebugJavaWithJavac' and 'compileDebugKotlin' tasks are set to the same. Follow the guidance given in the Kotlin Documentation you referenced: https://kotl.in/gradle/jvm/toolchain to adjust JVM toolchain settings.\n\nRemember to run 'react-native doctor' as you've mentioned yourself, this can provide additional insights about your development environment and might help to find missing configurations.\n\nFor the deprecated APIs - Each Android API level introduces some changes to the SDK which can deprecate older APIs, so keep that in mind when selecting the SDK levels. You can suppress these warnings if they are not affecting the app functionality now but it's strongly recommended to resolve these because they might cause issues in future Android versions. In some case, it could also be an indicator that it's time to update some of your dependencies.\n\nOne of the frequent errors in your build seems to be due to trying to assign values to a final variable 'mNotificationProps'. Take a look at the files indicated in the error messages and revise the code to respect the final attribute of the variable.\n\nOther errors also seem to stem from possible override errors between sub-classes and super-classes and type compatibility issues. Please review the methods involved, especially around the MainActivity and CustomPushNotification classes to look for any obvious mismatches or errors.\n\nI hope this helps guide you to a direction for resolution. If you have further queries, feel free to ask.

This event is fired whenever a new message is posted. In the payload of this event, you are provided the `channel_id` and `post_id` along with other details of the post.\n\nThe `response` and `thread_updated` websocket events are triggered when a user adds a new reply to an existing post or a thread. Specifically, `response` targets single-level comments while `thread_updated` handles thread-level updates.\n\nWith regards to `plugin_statuses_changed`, this event is triggered whenever one of your plugins changes its enabled/disables status, crashes, or is upgraded. It isn't specifically tied to playbooks but can provide changes in status of any plugin in your installation.\n\nI hope this clarifies your questions, feel free to follow up if anything was unclear, or you have more queries.

It's great to see you finding innovative ways to utilize the feature!\n\nThe key/value store provided by the Mattermost plugin API is indeed persistent. When a plugin is using the KVSet method, the data is saved in the Mattermost database and would persist even when the system reboots or the plugin is deactivated and then reactivated. So, technically speaking, it's not in-memory storage like redis, but it follows the standard data persistence rules.\n\nPlease keep in mind that you should avoid storing very large amounts of data in the key/value store as it's not designed for large data payloads but rather for small, frequently-accessed data (such as user permissions as you mentioned).\n\nAlso note that the key/value store can accommodate up to 64KB key/value pairs.\n\nPlease let me know if this answers your query or if you have any other questions or need us to clarify anything further.\n\nHappy coding!\n\nBest,\n~Mattermost AI Assistant\n\n[Disclaimer: This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

I understand you are encountering an occasional issue with the iOS client push notifications and email notifications in your deployed version 8.1.9 Mattermost via Docker.\n\nThis issue can occur due to a few reasons and sometimes this is related to certain settings in your client or the environment that it's being executed in. Here are some basic steps you could try to troubleshoot the issue:\n\n  1. Ensure the Mattermost notification settings are correctly configured. Visit 'Account Settings > Notifications' to review them.\n  2. Double check the settings on your iOS device. It's important to ensure that Mattermost notifications are enabled in 'Settings > Notifications'.\n  3. Check your email spam folder and ensure that emails from Mattermost are not being directed there.\n  4. Review Docker logs just to confirm if there are any relevant error messages that could give a hint about what might be happening.\n\n\n\nIf after these steps, the problem persists, please let us know, we will be eager to assist further. You're also welcome to continue the discussion here in the forums as there are a number of experienced community members who may have encountered similar issues.\n\nLooking forward to hearing about your progress.

This kind of setup has some drawbacks and you need to install it a bit differently.\n\n> I wish to install it on a subdomain such as chat.mydomaine.ch\n\nFor your unprivileged hosting you need either to use a port > 1024 (like the default 8065 because you can't bind ports <1024 without root) which leads to a server URL like _chat.foo.bar:8065_ or if possible use a reverse proxy in front of Mattermost, if your hosting provider offers a free configurable reverse proxy (best would be Nginx).\n\n> I tried the tarball install and I'm stuck as the commande : useradd --system --user-group mattermost returns useradd: command not found.\n\nYes, some parts of the instructions will fail because you don't have root. Though, Mattermost's default deployment from tarball assumes it ends up in **/opt** and is being run as an unprivileged user called _mattermost_. For this to setup you need root, but it's not a must to deploy it that way. In your case you need to use the existing user of your hosting and run Mattermost from there. So, when you come across something with a _mattermost_ user/group in the deploy commands, you need to use your username/group instead and instead of everything **/opt** use your home (or the path where you extracted the tarball).  \nWhen it comes to the systemd service; this is might not be possible because of missing access due to shared hosting (and the instructions need root again. But could also be done without root with user services). Here you need to start the `mattermost` binary otherwise (e.g. in a `tmux`, `screen`, usw).",

You've provided a detailed report and it's highly valuable, thank you.\n\nGiven the error message \"Invalid SSL certificate\" on your Android phone and \"remote error: tls: unknown certificate\" in your Mattermost logs, the issue is likely related to the SSL certificate chain on your server.\n\nEven though you're using a valid wildcard SSL certificate, it's possible that your server might not be configured correctly to serve the full certificate chain. The full certificate chain includes your certificate, any intermediate certificates, and the root certificate. Browsers and the Windows app can automatically fetch missing intermediate certificates most of the time (which is why you see no errors there), but mobile apps often face challenges with this.\n\nOne way to confirm this is by using an SSL Checker tool. Insert your FQDN into the tool and see if it reports any issues about the certificate chain or provides any advice on how to remediate it.\n\nIf the SSL Checker confirms that your server isn't sending the full certificate chain, you would need to consult your certificate provider's support to learn how to configure your server correctly.\n\nPlease give this a try, and don't hesitate to ask if you need further clarification or encounter any challenges.\n\nBest Regards,\n~Mattermost AI Assistant \ud83e\udd16\n\n[Disclaimer: This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

The error message appears when servers fail to register with TPNS, and this can happen for many reasons, like network issues, incorrect server settings, or issues with the TPNS service.\n\nBefore we dive deeper, could you please confirm a few details for us:\n\n  1. Double-check your server settings, especially related to push notifications. Is the TPNS server url exactly as \"https://push-test.mattermost.com/\"? (without quotation marks)\n  2. Please confirm if your Mattermost server is able to access this TPNS url? You may need to consult your network administrator for this info.\n  3. Are you seeing this issue on all devices or just some?\n\n\n\nIf everything appears to be set up correctly, then we could be dealing with a transient issue. I suggest trying again at a different time. In the event of the problem persisting, we can always explore more detailed debugging steps.\n\nYour patience is greatly appreciated and we're committed to helping you solve this.

What is supposed to happen is a message saying 'Motion detected' along with a picture from the camera.\n\nI would expect to see the image and message instead I am getting the message and a broken link icon. When I download the image link I do see the correct image.\n\nTwo things:  \n#1 I would like the image to show up in the MM channel, not a link icon.  \n#2 I would like the image to be inbedded in the message and not just a link to the file. This is because the file in question is frequently updated, so might not be relavent to the message at the time of reading. (This is not a show stopper if it can not happen)\n\n## The webhook code is:  \ncurl -i --insecure -X POST --data-urlencode 'payload={\"attachments\": [  \n{  \n\"fallback\": \"test\",  \n\"color\": \"#ff8000\",  \n\"text\": \"Picture below.\",  \n\"author_name\": \"Home Assistant\",  \n\"author_icon\": \"<https://mattermost.com/wp-contect-uploads/2022/02/icon_WS.png>\",  \n\"image_url\": \"<http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8123/local/tmp.porch.jpg>\",  \n\"title\": \"Porch Motion Detected!\"  \n}  \n]  \n} ' https://<<>>/hooks/<<< My Channel Key >>>>\n\nObservations:  \nA) The text and the Mattermost Icon all look as I expect. Only the picture from my server is broken icon.  \nB) If I copy the URL from Matter Most and past it into my web browser the picture is displayed.\n\nQuestions:  \nIs there a limit to the size of the picture MM can handle in a webhook like this?  \nDone it matter that I am downloading my picture using HTTP, and not HTTPS like the MM icon?\n\nAny assistance would be great.

Let's see if we can resolve your issue together.\n\nThe behavior you're reporting \u2013 getting the message with a broken link icon \u2013 generally happens when Mattermost can't retrieve or properly handle the image at the provided URL (`http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8123/local/tmp.porch.jpg`). There might be a few reasons why this is occurring.\n\n  1. **Image Size** : As you suspected, there might be a limit to the image size that Mattermost can handle. To verify this, could you try sending an image with smaller dimensions or file size and see if the problem persists?\n  2. **Image Accessibility** : Mattermost might not be able to access your image due to network restrictions. It's worth noting that while you can access the image URL from your browser, the Mattermost server might be in a different network context and may not have the same access.\n  3. **HTTP/HTTPS** : The protocol used for your image (HTTP in this case) should not generally be an issue. However, depending on your Mattermost server's configuration, it might only allow content from https URLs for security reasons.\n\n\n\nTo get to the bottom of this, you might also want to inspect your Mattermost server logs for any warning or error messages related to this operation. Those messages would likely provide more insights.\n\nFor embedding the image directly in the message rather than as a link, unfortunately, this might not be currently supported. As you noted, the image URL is fetched at the time of viewing, not when the webhook is called.\n\nDon't hesitate to let me know how your troubleshooting goes or if you have any further questions. We're here to help!\n\nBest,  \n~Mattermost AI Assistant ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

                "message_content": "Hello Bo-Yin,\n\nThanks for bringing up this interesting point. Directly within Mattermost, the ability to display different images based on device orientation is currently not supported. This is because Mattermost primarily operates as a text-based communication platform and the feature you're asking for typically falls within the scope of responsive web design, commonly handled by webpage coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\nHowever, your suggestion is quite valuable and could serve as an enhancement for our platform. We appreciate innovative suggestions like this as they inspire to improve and evolve, meeting our users' needs in the best possible way.\n\nI'd recommend you to post this as a feature idea on our [Feature Idea Forum](https://mattermost.uservoice.com/forums/306457-general) where it can be upvoted by others who share your interest. This is how we gauge community interest and plan our future development roadmap.\n\nIn the meantime, as a workaround, you can design something outside of Mattermost, like creating a responsive HTML page which changes images based on display size, and share the URL to that page in your posts.\n\nKeep your creative suggestions coming. We appreciate your contribution to the community!\n\nBest wishes,\n~Mattermost AI Assistant ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

I'm sorry to hear about the error you're encountering when uploading multiple images on Mattermost, and thanks for the detailed explanation, it helps a lot.\n\nFrom the error message and your description, it seems like the error is happening during the process of creating preview and thumbnail images. This can happen due to various reasons such as network instability, file corruption or configuration issues.\n\nHere are some things you can try:\n\n1. **Check your Mattermost Server version**: Your version is 9.3.0, ensure it's up to date.\n2. **File Permissions**: Please, make sure that your S3 Bucket has the correct file and folder permissions.\n3. **Network stability**: Sometimes due to unstable Internet connections, file uploading or parsing may fail.\n4. **Image Files**: Try to check if the image files are not corrupted. You can attempt to open them in a different viewer or try to re-upload them one by one to see what happens.\n\nIf the issue still persists, it might be a bug that needs a deeper look into the situation. In that case, could you raise a GitHub issue with more technical details including the type of images being uploaded, any special configurations or variables, etc?\n\nWe appreciate your contribution to Mattermost's vibrant community and your patience while we try to resolve this issue. Don't hesitate to let me know if you have any more questions.\n\nBest regards,  \n~Mattermost AI Assistant \ud83e\udd16\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

I can see how the bulk import issue might be confusing and frustrating, and I certainly understand the importance of getting all your data migrated to Mattermost.\n\nBased on the information you've provided, it seems the error may be originating from the inconsistency between user data in the Slack export file and the users in the Mattermost instance currently. Although you mentioned all users in the JSONL file have a valid username, there might be a case where the username or user information in the Slack export doesn't match any existing users on your Mattermost instance.\n\nHere are a few simple steps to try to troubleshoot the problem:\n\n1. Make sure that all usernames in the Slack export match those in the Mattermost instance. Be sure to check for any orthographic errors or inconsistencies.\n2. Review the format of the Slack export file, especially the user blocks, and ensure it follows the format indicated in the [documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/onboard/migrate-to-mattermost.html#migrating-from-slack-using-the-mattermost-bulk-import-tool).\n3. You could try importing a small subset of your data first. This might help to narrow down the problematic users, if any.\n\nIf these steps still don't work, it might be useful to review the log files for more detailed error messages and the debug information.\n\nI hope this helps. Please update this thread once you've tried these steps, and we'll be here to assist you further. Remember, we're committed to ensuring a successful transition to Mattermost!\n\nBest wishes,\n~Mattermost AI Assistant ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

The catch here, and I don't know if this is a potential cause, the first time I ran mmctl config edit I was able to adjust the filepaths for the SSL certs. No change since has stuck.\n\nCurrently, I'm trying to enable plugin uploads. I manually edited the mmomni.yml per the documentation, which did save. Restarted the server. Still can't upload plugins. I would rather not do the CLI installation. Any ideas why mmctl config edit changes aren't being saved? I wouldn't think that changing the plugin upload value from false to true would be an invalid change - and thus be ignored.\n\nThanks",

However, I am encountering issues in achieving two objectives:\n\n1. Enable HTTPS\n2. Use port 80 instead of 8065\n\nEnvironment\n\n- Amazon Lightsail\n- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS\n\nSteps to reproduce\n\n1. Run the following command in the terminal:\n\n$ curl -o- https://deb.packages.mattermost.com/repo-setup.sh | sudo bash\n\n2. Install Mattermost Omnibus by running the following command:\n\n$ sudo apt install mattermost-omnibus -y\n\n3. Enter the domain and email address when prompted.\n4. Access the domain.\n\nExpected Behavior\n\n1. The website should be accessible at https://example.com/.\n2. If accessed at http://example.com/, the website should redirect to https://example.com.\n\nObserved behavior\n\nI am only able to access the website at http://example.com:8065, and not on port 80. and I can't use https.\n\nWhat I tried\n\nI tried changing the settings from the web console, but I was unable to make any changes. Here is a screenshot of the error:\n\nI also tried changing the settings from the file /etc/mattermost/mmomni.mattermost.env, but the changes were not saved.

We purchased a TLS certificate through GoDaddy and are attempting to set it up for mattermost. The files we receved consisted of 2 .crt files and a .pem file. Based on my research, the .pem file is the TLS certificate file. We also received a generated-private-key.txt file and a generated-csr.txt file.\n\nI may be configuring this completely wrong but I pointed to the .pem for the certificate file and the private-key.txt file for the tls key file settings. Upon restarting mattermost per the instructions, I am no longer able to access mattermost. The port settings are set to use port 443 and I even try to access mattermost on the server itself using \"localhost\" but am having on success and had to revert to a saved snapshot of the server to restore functionality without TLS.\n\nI suspect I am doing something wrong but this is my first time messing with TLS so I'm hoping I can get some assistance.\n\n**Observed behavior**  \nWhat did you see happen? Please include relevant error messages and/or screenshots.  \nMentioned above.",

It sounds like maybe yours is, and you're referring to something that suggests putting the passphrase into a .txt file That A) won't work with Mattermost, and B) is pointless\u2026 if anyone has access to the file containing the key, they can read your text file, too.\n\nYou could also follow the instructions for Let's Encrypt and see if that works.

I have a self hosted community server (v9.2.3).\n\nIf you happen to run a playbook in a private channel, then a user can find the run, join/participate the run, and gain access to that private channel via the @playbooks BOT adding them to the private channel.\n\nThis for me is a privacy issue I was not expecting to encounter.  \nProbably one solution is to get the enterprise version that provides private channels, but it's not in our budget possiblities. And again, I did not expect that this would be possible in private channel.\n\nIs there anyway to prevent this behaviour?\n\nThank you.  \nMatt",

The error message you're receiving seems to indicate an issue with the validation of a digital signature.\n\nHere are a few things to check or try:\n\n1. **App Secret:** Ensure the App secret is correctly configured. This error message, \"signature is invalid,\" usually pops up when there is a discrepancy between the secret used by Mattermost and the Nextcloud app. Double-check the app secret configured in Mattermost matches that configured in your Nextcloud app.\n\n2. **URL Corrections:** Please verify the URL \"http://localhost:8082/manifest.json\" used during the \"/apps install\" process. Ensure there is no trailing space or unnecessary characters that could potentially lead to mismatches or validation errors.\n\n3. **Firewall/Security Settings:** Sometimes, security settings or firewall configurations can block communication between Mattermost and the apps. Ensure the firewall settings are not blocking the IP of Mattermost or the localhost:8082.\n\n4. **Docker Compose:** Make sure your Docker compose up process didn't fail and that it's correctly deploying the app as expected. Double-check the console logs for any warnings or errors.\n\n5. **App Updates:** It might be helpful to ensure that all your Mattermost and Nextcloud plugins/apps are updated to the latest versions, as this might affect compatibility.\n\n6. **Restart Services:** After making these changes, be sure to restart your Mattermost service as well as your Nextcloud app.\n\nIf these suggestions do not resolve your issue, could you please provide some additional information? The exact copy of Mattermost Server logs and Apps plugin logs around the time this issue is happening would be very helpful for further troubleshooting.\n\nPlease let me know how it goes or if you need further assistance. We're here to help!\n\nBest Regards,\n~Mattermost AI Assistant \ud83e\udd16\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

OS allows notifications, sound is on.\n  * Computer has Mattermost Client v5.6.0 app running.\n  * Another user sends me messages on a private conversation A (1 to 1).\n  * We consider the push notification is working if it shows a message on the screen with a sound.\n\n\n\n**Those tests are OK :**  \nIf I am out of conversation A on computer and phone app is closed, I receive notifications on phone and computer.  \nIf I display conversation A on any device, I don't receive notifications on any device.\n\n**This causes us trouble :**  \nHowever, if on the phone I use the upper-left arrow to get out of the conversation, I don't receive notifications on phone or computer, even if I left the app in background, or if I lock the phone.  \nit seems to works as if I still was displaying the conversation.\n\n![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/mattermost/original/2X/d/dc01ebf2a6b5a416cd63c3114608a911c1c9da96.png)\n\nTwo ways we found to avoid this is to select another conversation on the mobile app, or to kill the app in the background. Doing this, we systematically had the notifications.\n\nWe will explain this to the users, but it is not very practical to do.\n\nWould that be possible to fix this ?\n\nFeel free to test if you have the same behavior.\n\nNote that on one of our Android devices, there also is a back button on the system on bottom of screen, and if used, it behave differently, really gets out of conversation A and we have notifications.

I tried to fix that to the URL here to the correct value (`postgres://mmuser:mmuser_password@postgres:5432/mattermost?sslmode=disable\\u0026connect_timeout=10`) but this had no effect (after restart of the container).\n\nCan you give me any good advice on how to debug this further?\n\nChristian",

We appreciate you providing such a comprehensive overview of the issue you're experiencing as well - this makes our troubleshooting much easier.\n\nFrom what you've detailed, you seem to have done quite an extensive job troubleshooting the issue on your end. I appreciate the level of effort you've put into resolving this concern.\n\nRegarding the log event:\n\n`\"caller\": \"app/plugin_api.go:976\", \"level\": \"error\", \"msg\": \"callback failed: call state is missing from channel state\", \"origin\": \"main. (*Plugin). handleLeave websocket.go:454\", \"plugin_id\": \"com.mattermost.calls\", \"timestamp\": \"2023-12-07 12:59:21.345 z\"`\n\nThe \"call state is missing from channel state\" message might indicate a problem with synchronized changes in the call states or any potential error in the plugin or calls setup.\n\nFirstly, I recommend you to ensure your RTC configuration aligns with our guides on [Configuring WebRTC (Beta)](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#webrtc-beta). It could also be worth verifying if the Mattermost Calls plugin is properly configured and updated to the latest version.\n\nAs you mentioned using Docker for Mattermost deployment, it might be worth checking whether the Docker network settings are correctly configured and there are no conflicts, particularly regarding exposed and published ports.\n\nIf you've already validated all these factors or the issue persists after checking, I recommend you to file a bug report in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues) so our engineers can further investigate this. Make sure to include all these details that you've provided here and any additional information that may help us understand the problem better.\n\nYour patience and understanding are greatly appreciated.

I am worried that having Jitsi (not an app I deployed) and this one running on the same host may cause a problem. Since this is testing for us, I might spin up a second server with just Mattermost running on it to eliminate any conflicts that might occur that way. If it works, then I know there's something funky going on with the docker config and/or running Jitsi and Mattermost containers from the same host. I'll update to the latest while I'm at it.

You could try to run certbot directly on your Ubuntu host, at least that's what I do, or maybe change the port for certbot inside that script. In that case you will likely need a corresponding nginx config for certbot pointing to the new port\n\nChanging nginx away from port 80 isn't the right approach in my opinion, because you want your incoming clients to talk to the nginx reverse proxy on port 80 and 443 (redirecting to Mattermost on 8065) and not to certbot.",

It doesn't seem like it's a configuration issue, as it seems everything matches up to how it should in the documentation, but it's just timing out for some reason.\n\nEdit: Also forgot to mention. Push notifications previously worked when I first set up Mattermost. One day they just stopped working without any changes being made to the server. I just upgraded from Mattermost 4.3 to 4.10 last night in hopes that there may have been a fix for the push notifications\n\nEdit 2: I just received one single push notification on my phone today. The first I have received in months. A co-worker also said the same, he received a single push notification today, first in months. Strange that one single notification made it through today.

Let's work through this problem together.\n\nThe error message \"NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource\" you're encountering is often caused by network issues. Here are a few things you can check:\n\n1. Internet Connectivity: Ensure that your server has a stable internet connection and can reach the Mattermost servers.\n\n2. Plugin File: Be sure that the plugin file you're trying to upload is not corrupted or damaged. It could be helpful to re-download the plugin from the Focalboard GitHub page.\n\n3. File Size Limits: Check if there are any file size limits on your server that could be preventing the upload. The Focalboard plugin may be larger than the Mattermost demo plugin.\n\nIf these steps don't resolve your problem, it would be helpful to provide additional information:\n\n- What version of Mattermost are you using?\n- Can you kindly share the exact steps you're taking to install the plugin?\n- If possible, could you share any relevant log data?\n\nAny extra information you provide will help me assist you better!\n\nThanks,\n~Mattermost AI Assistant\n\n[Disclaimer: This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

The 'default' setting in the docker compose file is noticeably a smaller number than the size of the focalboard plugin file.\n\nGood luck, I hope you fix your problem.",

So far, so good.\n\nUnfortunately, we've had a lot of trouble with the MySQL operator both in general and with regard to some other applications, and so decided to eliminate it, since it wasn't adding a lot of value to our small cluster anyway. We believed that we could handle Mattermost's database the same way we had successfully handled others, namely:\n\n  1. Scale down the Mattermost deployment on the cluster to zero pods.\n  2. Eliminate the current database instance and the mysql-operator installation, but leave the private volume with all the MySQL data files behind.\n  3. Manually create a MySQL deployment and service to run MySQL over that same private volume, so it would pick up the previous databases just as they were before, and would be accessible at the same location (mattermostdb.mattermost.svc.cluster.local).that they were before.\n  4. Make sure that that database is accessible (it is) and isn't configured read-only/super-read-only (it isn't).\n  5. Start Mattermost back up, at which point everything should work just like it did before.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nMattermost starts up and runs normally.\n\n**Observed behavior**\n\nThe Mattermost container won't stay started. It exits shortly after starting up with exit code 2. No logs are displayed for the pod.\n\nAny thoughts on what this might be?",

Also altering user auth type and then restarting the mysql server and/or flushing the privileges.  \n2- The `ECASE exception` problem. This is a problem would occur after a successful authentication. Yet this is another issue with the mysql-8 and pgLoader with it's pre-compiled versions.

Nonetheless, while I think I can see how it got this way, the issue in question was so weirdly nonintuitive I feel like I ought to write it up for the next person to run into it. Feel free to move it if this isn't the right place)_\n\nScenario:\n\nMattermost is running as a container under Kubernetes (configured by the Mattermost operator), using as its back-end a Postgres database running in the same cluster. For configuring the connection to the database, we have a k8s secret defined thus:\n\n```\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: mattermost-db-credentials\n  namespace: mattermost\nstringData:\n  DB_CONNECTION_STRING: \"postgres://mattermost:PASSWORD_GOES_HERE@postgres-mattermost-postgresql.mattermost.svc.cluster.local:5432/mattermost?sslmode=disable\"\n```\n\nwhich is referenced by the Mattermost manifest thus:\n\n```\n    database:\n      external:\n        secret: mattermost-db-credentials\n```\n\nand so comes through in the final definition of the Mattermost pod thus:\n\n```\n      env:\n        - name: MM_CONFIG\n          valueFrom:\n            secretKeyRef:\n              name: mattermost-db-credentials\n              key: DB_CONNECTION_STRING\n```\n\nSo far, so good. It worked fine like this for a long time.\n\nUntil we needed to move that Postgres database. Same data and configuration - running off literally the same back-end storage - so all that would happen is the connection string changes. So all we should need to do is update that in the _mattermost-db-credentials_ secret and restart the Mattermost pod, and all should be okay, yes?\n\nNo.\n\nAfter updating the connection string (and making sure the new pod was picking it up), Mattermost wouldn't start, and worse, the pod logs kept indicating that Mattermost couldn't connect to the database _using the old connection string_ , which was nowhere in the visible configuration.\n\nAfter a little poking at this, it turns out that we would only see _that_ error when Mattermost was properly configured with the _new_ connection string, and _not_ when it was configured with a blatantly erroneous connection string.\n\nSo, after taking a moment to say \"Wut?\", it occurred to me to fire up my Postgres client and take a look at the _configurations_ table in the Mattermost database, find the latest entry per the _createat_ column, and what do I find:\n\n![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/mattermost/original/2X/1/1acbbb480bba905f10f0e53d182f585fa67d853c.png)\n\nThe _old_ connection string stored in the database! (And yes, changing the connection string in that entry in the new database eliminated the error and let Mattermost start up correctly; apparently Mattermost was connecting to the database at the new location for just long enough to read the latest configuration entry, pull the old connection string out of it, and then fail to connect to it at that old location.)\n\nMy working hypothesis here (not having had time to dig through the code to check if I'm right; I welcome corrections from those who know better) is that Mattermost copied the connection settings specified on the pod into the database way back when it was started the first time, and since then, those have been overriding the environment variables the operator sets on the pod, leading to a situation where any changes you make to the configuration on the k8s side end up simply ignored.\n\nWhich, well, I can see how it got there, but man, it's confusing as hell when it actually happens to you.\n\n\u2026this maybe also should be a feature request to let environment variables always unconditionally override the configuration in the database, or at least always in k8s scenarios?",

However, the bundle ID isn't reflecting your changes.\n\nWhile you've already adjusted the App Icon and App Name as per Mattermost's Trademark policy, you might be missing a step in code itself.\n\nIn addition to updating the bundle ID in Xcode, you should also update it in the `Info.plist` file of the project. You'll find this file in the `<ProjectName>/ios/<ProjectName>/Info.plist` path. Replace every instance of the existing bundle ID (com.mattermost.rnbeta) with your new bundle ID. Also ensure to change the bundle ID for each of your required targets.\n\nTry this, recompile your application, and see if the issue gets resolved. If not, please feel free to post your responses here. We are committed to helping you get this resolved! Remember, no question is too big or small - We're in this together!\n\nBest,  \n~Mattermost AI Assistant ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

I understand that you're facing a problem with Software Updater on Ubuntu 22.04 when trying to update via the Mattermost repository.\n\nThe warning message you're seeing about skipping acquisition of main/binary-i386/Packages suggests that it's trying to get i386 (32-bit) packages from the Mattermost repository, which isn't supported as our deb repository only provides 64-bit packages. This could be the reason why you're facing issues with Software Updater.\n\nA helpful step you can follow:\n\nAdd `[arch=amd64]` after `deb` in your sources list for Mattermost. Your entry should look like this:\n\n`deb [arch=amd64] https://deb.packages.mattermost.com ./`\n\nNow, run `sudo apt update` again and that should solve your problem. Please note, this will tell your system to only request 64-bit packages from the Mattermost repository.\n\nAlternatively, you can remove the i386 architecture from the list of architectures that your system is configured to fetch packages for:\n\n`sudo dpkg --remove-architecture i386`\n\nPlease exercise caution as this will prevent your system from fetching any further updates for 32-bit packages. Only apply this if you're sure you won't be needing 32-bit package updates in the future.\n\nI hope this helps.

In order to let Jira users create subscriptions, we needed to make one webhook connect to the plugin, and allow the users to create subscriptions inside of Mattermost.\n\nThe problem is that the webhook will receive all events from Jira. You can filter the webhook with JQL on Jira's side, but the JQL will apply to all subscriptions. The reason why we cannot use JQL inside of the subscription, is that when we receive a webhook event, we would need to call Jira's API with each JQL statement stored in each subscription, which is very non-performant. Instead, we do not communicate with Jira's API at all during the subscription webhook event calls.",

I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble connecting to your Mattermost installation via your domain name.\n\nBased on the description given, it might be a DNS issue. This happens when your domain name is not properly mapped to the IP address of your VM. Here are some steps you can try:\n\n  1. Please verify if your domain name is correctly pointing to the IP of your Ubuntu VM. You can use online tools like `ping`, `nslookup`, or `dig` with your domain name to confirm this.\n\n  2. If the domain name does correctly resolve to the Ubuntu VM's IP but you still can't access Mattermost, there might be some configuration issues with your Mattermost setup. Can you confirm if your `mmomni.yml` file is correctly filled with the domain's name, scheme, and port? It should look somewhat like this:\n\n    ```\n    fqdn: your-domain\n    scheme: http # or https if you have SSL\n    port: 8065 # or another port if you have changed it\n    ```\n\n  * As for the `WARNING: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available` message, this is a common informational message and might not indicate a problem with your setup. However, if your domain name isn't being recognized by your server, this warning could be valid.\n\nIf these steps don't help resolve your problem, can you provide more details about your `mmomni.yml` file and DNS settings? Please make sure to redact any sensitive information from those.\n\nLooking forward to your response,\n\n~Mattermost AI Assistant :robot:\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

The mmctl import process \u2026 command actually returns \"Status: pending\", but for about a dozen of seconds, all mmctl import job show \u2026 return \"Coonnection refused\" on port 8065 or (IIRC) \"502 Gateway Timeout\" via Nginx.\n\nIn /var/log/mattermost/mattermost.log I also see the typical startup message of the Mattermost server, but before that nothing what looks like a shutdown. So I suspect it's a crash.\n\nHere's an excerpt from /var/log/mattermost/mattermost.log when it restarted after starting processing a bulk import (the first line from 09:36 is the last line from the previous restart):\n\n[Log excerpt omitted for brevity]\n\n\u2022 I just noticed I have about 20 import jobs running with \"Status: in_progress\", mostly because my workflow initially exited on \"Connection refused\". And the oldest of these \"in progress\" import jobs are from 8 days (!) ago. It also seems as if those are all the import jobs where the Mattermost server restarted after starting the processing of the bulk import.\n\nSample mmctl import job show \u2026 output:\n\n[Sample output omitted for brevity]\n\n(Note that this command has been run on 2022-10-14, i.e. on the day of this posting.)\n\nBasically my main question on both things is: Is this normal? :wink:\n\nOr to be more precise:\n\n\u2022 Is a server restart to be expected when starting to process a bulk import?\n\n\u2022 Is it normal that importing a chat history with nearly 100'000 messages including attachements (up to 710 MB) takes over a week? (Without attachments and restart/crash it IIRC was just around 10 minutes.)\n\nAnd is it possible that a huge import blocks later smaller imports. Because some of these imports are also just debug imports with just a single line of chat. And they are also \"in progress\" for a week or so.\n\nAnd as a follow up question (assuming that this isn't normal :slight_smile:):\n\n\u2022 How can I cancel or clean up bulk import jobs, especially those in process? Haven't found anything into that direction in the mmctl documentation.\n\nHappened with Mattermost v7.3.0 instealled via the omnibus .deb on Debian 11.

There's no healthcheck for the running job and I think not even a restart of the server fixes this state.\n\nxtaran:\n\n> How can I cancel or clean up bulk import jobs\n\nThere's no way to do that currently, unfortunately, besides fixing the job's state in the database directly.",

We understand that it can be frustrating when something doesn't work as expected and we appreciate your patience and effort to reach out to us.\n\nBased on your description of the issue, a potential problem area could be the networking configuration of the Docker containers, specifically how the WebSockets are being handled by Traefik.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to start with:\n\n  * Please ensure the WebSocket is enabled and correctly configured in your Docker and Traefik setup.\n\n  * Additionally, make sure the `ws` and `wss` protocols are properly enabled in your Traefik configuration file.\n\n  * Take a closer look at the network setting and the attached network interfaces of the containers.\n\n  * Pay close attention to Mattermost's configuration, specifically the Site URL and the WebSocket URL, and ensuring they point to the right addresses.\n\n  * Try to access the Mattermost instance directly (bypassing Traefik) to see if the problem persists. If the direct access works, it could indicate that factors specific to Traefik are causing the issue.\n\n\n\n\nIf you've tried all the above and are still encountering difficulties, please share more detail about your Docker and Traefik setup. Attaching the relevant configuration files would be great (please remember to redact any sensitive data). This may not present an immediate solution, but it will give us a clearer idea of your current environment and help us troubleshoot more effectively.\n\nWe are here to help you.

Upgrading to the latest server (currently 7.8.12) might resolve the issue you're experiencing.\n2. **Update the Push Notification Server**: As you're using version 5.24.0, please consider updating to the latest version.\n3. **Raise a GitHub Issue**: If the problem continues after these updates, please create a new issue in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-push-proxy/issues/new).

The issue you described usually occurs if there are problems with either your SSL certificate or your DNS configuration.\n\nHere are a few steps to help troubleshoot this issue:\n\n1. Verify your SSL Certificate: Check if your SSL certificate and its corresponding chain are correctly installed. You can use online tools like SSL Labs' SSL Server Test tool and input your domain to inspect your SSL configuration.\n\n2. Check DNS Settings: Ensure your DNS settings are correctly pointing to your Mattermost server. This is important because your SSL Certificate is tied to your domain name. If your DNS settings are not configured correctly, the SSL Certificate cannot be verified.\n\n3. Check Port Accessibility: Make sure port 443 (HTTPS) is open and accessible. The SSL certificate validation fails if the port is blocked or not accessible for other reasons.\n\nIf you have followed these steps and are still experiencing the issue, could you please provide a little more information about your current setup? Specifically, how your DNS and SSL are configured. Also, please confirm whether you're using a self-signed certificate or one issued by a trusted certificate authority.\n\nRemember not to share any sensitive data or passwords.

I appreciate you sharing such detailed information, it's really helpful.\n\nBased on the error message you posted, there seems to be an issue when your \"com.mattermost.calls\" plugin tries to access the database. Specifically that the database is closed when it's trying to get the channel state.\n\nHere are some initial troubleshooting steps we can follow:\n\n  1. Confirm database connection: Let's validate that your database is running, accessible and that Mattermost is correctly configured to connect to it. You can refer to our [database setup documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/install/config-database.html) for more details.\n\n  2. Plugin version: Check if you're running the latest version of the calls plugin. An update might resolve the issue.\n\n  3. Restart Mattermost: Sometimes, simply restarting the Mattermost server can clear up transient issues.\n\n  4. Reinstall the plugin: If none of the above work, you may want to try uninstalling and reinstalling the plugin.\n\n\n\n\nIf after these steps the issue persist, we may need to look deeper into the situation. Please let me know how the steps above work out and provide any new log entries or observations you find.\n\nBest Regards,  \n~Mattermost AI Assistant :robot:\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

You're getting errors saying that \"Another plugin may be using the same directory name, destination already exists.\"\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot:\n\n1. **Check for Directory Issues:** You may want to manually check the directories mentioned in the error logs, specifically /mattermost/prepackaged_plugins/ and /mattermost/plugins. Ensure that there are no residual or uncompleted installations left in these directories. Clear out any data from a previous installation that failed or was not completed.\n\n2. **Verify Permissions:** Confirm if the permissions on your Mattermost directories (especially the plugins directory) are set correctly for your instance and the admin account used to run Mattermost has the necessary access.\n\n3. **Manual Updates:** Try manually downloading and installing the newer versions of the plugins via the System Console. A point to note here - it would be a safer option to backup your data (especially the plugin configurations) before proceeding with this step.\n\n4. **Investigate Docker Volume Mounts:** The docker volumes for your plugins may be interfering with the installation process. Assuming the syntax being correct, check to make sure the `MATTERMOST_PLUGINS_PATH` and `MATTERMOST_CLIENT_PLUGINS_PATH` variables are correctly mapped to their respective paths.\n\n5. **Address the Jira Token Issue:** The error log you provided mentions Jira \"losing its token\". Make sure the token isn't expiring or being invalidated for some reason. You may want to reconnect with `/jira connect`, as suggested by the error log, once you've addressed the above issues.\n\nIf you continue to encounter issues after these steps, please provide us with further information about your setup, such as the OS you're running Mattermost on, the version of Docker being used, and any other relevant details that might help us in diagnosing the issue.\n\nLet's work through this together to solve your problem and get those plugins updated.\n\nBest,\n~Mattermost AI Assistant \ud83e\udd16\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

This could be due to various reasons, such as an issue with the file structure or an error during the signing process.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, I recommend the following steps:\n\n  1. Make sure that the original file, `Mattermost-unsigned.ipa`, is in the correct location and accessible to the signing process.\n  2. Verify that the certificate, `Apple Distribution: XX XX`, is valid and properly configured for signing iOS apps. Double-check that the correct certificate is selected during the signing process.\n  3. Ensure that the specified display name, `XXXX`, is correct and matches the app's configuration.\n  4. Verify that you have the necessary permissions and access rights to perform the signing process and create the output file, `XXXX.ipa`.\n\n\n\nIf the issue persists after these steps, please provide more details about the process you are following to sign the app, including any relevant commands or tools being used. This will help me provide more specific assistance.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or need additional help!\n\nBest regards,  \n~Matterbot 2.0 ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by ChatGPT.

I'm sorry to hear about the issues you're experiencing.\n\nAs per your description, it seems that the Mattermost Desktop App is not correctly handling your SSL configuration for the port 8066 and is omitting it during the connection process.\n\nTo clarify, this is not a known limitation of the Linux Mattermost desktop app. The Mattermost desktop app should work with SSL configurations on custom ports. We currently support a wide range of SSL configurations with self-managed certificates and different ports. However, particular settings and configurations may have unique behaviors.\n\nIn this case, I would recommend first ensuring that your certificate isn't only catering to the default HTTPS port (443), but also includes the 8066 port for SSL.\n\nFor the missing certificates.json file in ~/.config/mattermost, you may manually add the SSL certificates into this file. The file format should look like this:\n\n{\n\"https://myhost.domain.com:8066/\": \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\\nYour-Cert-Is-Here\\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\"\n}\n\nRemember to replace \"Your-Cert-Is-Here\" with your actual certification content. After saving and restarting the app, it should take the new SSL configuration into account.\n\nPlease try the given steps and let me know how things progress. If you continue to face the same problem, I would gather more detailed logs or information to escalate the issue to our support team.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this. Looking forward to resolving this matter swiftly.\n\nBest Regards,\n~Mattermost AI Assistant \ud83e\udd16\n\n[Disclaimer: This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

Your detailed report helps a lot to understand the situation.\n\nThe log errors you provided indicate that there seems to be some sort of connection issue causing the Jira plugin to not respond as expected. One common cause for this is related to server resource limitations. Could you please verify if the server where Mattermost and Jira are installed has enough resources (like CPU or memory) available?\n\nAlso, please consider the following steps:\n\n1. Make sure the Mattermost server, including the Jira plugin, has been restarted after the plugin installation.\n2. Ensure that the URL and credentials provided for the Jira service in the plugin settings are correct and the server is accessible from the Mattermost server.\n3. Check if the plugin settings in Mattermost have the correct permissions and roles assigned to use the '/jira' command.\n\nLastly, you're running Mattermost 9.2.2 and the Jira Plugin 4.0. There might be compatibility issues, as Mattermost's latest version is 6.2, and the newest Jira plugin is 3.1.1. We recommend keeping Mattermost and its plugins up-to-date to benefit from the latest features, improvements, and fixes.\n\nIf you've already checked these points and the issue still persists, I'd suggest you to check with your PaaS, server or network admin to ensure that nothing is blocking the connection between Mattermost and Jira.\n\nLooking forward to solving the issue together.\n\nBest,\n~Mattermost AI Assistant \ud83e\udd16\n\n[Disclaimer: This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

This sometimes occurs when the IP address is unfamiliar to the email server or has been flagged due to prior suspicious activity.\n\nA common issue can also be the incorrect DNS settings. Check if your domain has the right MX records set up, as wrong MX records or their absence can cause such problems.\n\nAlso, I would like to point out that there can be a delay in delivering emails based on the server load and priority of the email.\n\nIf all these configurations seem correct and the issue persists, could you try sending an email to another domain to see if the issue is specific to the recipient's domain?\n\nLastly, please do share more relevant information such as your email server, the version of Mattermost you are using, and any recent changes that were made in the environment that could lead to this issue.\n\nYour cooperation and patience in this matter are greatly appreciated.

It's great to hear that you have set up the Github integration with the Github plugin and it's working properly.\n\nAs per your description, it seems like you're having a problem with webhook event announcements in your specific Mattermost channel. Sure, this is absolutely possible and it seems like you're on the right track.\n\nThe things you may want to check are:\n\n  1. Double-check Github Webhook: Make sure that you've set up the webhook in your GitHub repository settings to send events to your Mattermost instance. The payload URL should point to your Mattermost instance's API endpoint, with something like this `https://your-mattermost-url.com/plugins/com.mattermost.github/webhook`.\n\n  2. Webhook Events: Check that the events you specifically want to trigger announcements (like repo creation/deletion, starring a repo, etc.) are actually checked in the GitHub webhook settings.\n\n  3. Channel Subscription: In your Mattermost channel, ensure that you've subscribed to the actual repo using the appropriate slash command. For example: `/github subscribe owner/repo` would be the command to subscribe to a specific repo's notifications in your channel.\n\n  4. Plugin Settings: Ensure that your plugin settings in the Mattermost system console allow for the events that you'd like to receive.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have checked all those things and are still not getting notifications as desired, it may be helpful for troubleshooting if you could provide more specifics on your configuration or any error messages you may be encountering.\n\nHope this helps, and don't hesitate to write back if you need further assistance. We're here to help!\n\nBest regards,  \n~Mattermost AI Assistant ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

Have you verified the server firewall rules? Mattermost requires certain ports to be open for communications.\n  2. Have you checked if the Mattermost server can reach the internet directly without the need of a VPN?\n  3. Are there any network policies or settings at your ISP or cloud provider (Hetzner Cloud) that could be affecting the connection?\n\n\n\nAdditionally, please check your Mattermost server logs. They should give you an indication of what might be going wrong when a client tries to connect.\n\nFeel free to share any information you're comfortable with.

Let's address your questions one by one:\n\n1. **Database Selection**: Focalboard can work with SQLite or MySQL. By default, it comes with SQLite which perfectly satisfies the needs of a single user. MySQL or PostgreSQL would become more relevant when running Focalboard for multiple users due to better concurrent access. However, for your use case, I would suggest sticking with SQLite. It should serve you well and keep things simple as you prefer.\n\n2. **Access Via LAN Address**: Yes, you can definitely use your LAN IP address for local home access to Focalboard. No need to install Nginx for that. However, remember to ensure you have the correct network configurations for permitted access.\n\n3. **Access via Tailscale**: Given that you've set up Tailscale access to your home server, you should indeed be able to access Focalboard from your work PC without needing to open up router ports or use Nginx.\n\nDon't worry about asking questions, that's what the community is here for! Let me know if you need more assistance. We're excited for you to get started with Focalboard!\n\nBest regards,\n~Mattermost AI Assistant :robot:\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

Once that's done, a session token will be saved in `mmctl`'s config and you can use this token for all further commands.\n\nAlternatively, you can enable Mattermost's so-called \"local mode\" by changing the value of `EnableLocalMode` in its `config.json` to `true`and after a server restart, you can use the socket-authenticated `mmctl --local` with all available commands without having to do a separate login first.",

The conclusion of the feature request and the repository issue you've linked indicates that this might not yet be fully supported. However, the landscape has been changing, and I will check if there have been any changes in this regard.\n\nI will bring this to the attention of our dev team to further investigate the issue on our end as well. It may be possible that your bot doesn't have the correct permissions set for file uploads. While we're looking into this, could you also please check if your bot has the correct roles and permissions assigned for file uploads?\n\nPlease note that it's critical to ensure that any bot interactions comply with the existing permissions, these restrictions are in place to ensure the overall security of the system.\n\nAlso, remember to always keep your API token secure and undisclosed. For the purposes of community support, it's recommended to not include sensitive data like API keys or tokens in your posts.\n\nI'll make sure to keep you updated with any progress we make on this issue. Thanks for your patience and understanding, and feel free to ask if you have any other questions.\n\nBest,\n~Mattermost AI Assistant ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

The error message indicates that there was an issue fetching user information from the Jira server, resulting in a 400 Bad Request error with the response stating \"invalid_grant\" and \"Invalid aud: https://auth.atlassian.io\".\n\nThis error typically occurs when there is a misconfiguration in the Jira server or the Jira app link. To troubleshoot this issue, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Verify the Jira server URL: Ensure that the `mattermost.server.url` parameter you provided is correct and matches the URL of your Mattermost server.\n2. Check the Jira app configuration: Review the configuration settings for the Jira app and ensure that the redirect URLs are correctly specified. Make sure that the redirect URL matches the URL where your Mattermost server is accessible.\n3. Validate Jira app credentials: Verify that the Jira app credentials (client ID and secret) are correctly set up in Mattermost and match the credentials provided in Jira. Double-check that you have entered them accurately without any typos.\n4. Ensure proper network connectivity: Confirm that your Mattermost server is accessible from the Jira server without any network restrictions or firewalls blocking the connection.\n\nIf you've gone through these steps and the issue persists, it may be helpful to provide more details about your configuration and any additional error messages you receive. This will enable us to provide more specific guidance to resolve the problem.\n\nBest regards,\n~Matterbot 1.0\n\n_[Disclaimer: This is a new automated response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

The error message you shared indicates a problem with the authentication process.

Verify the configuration: Double-check the integration settings in Mattermost and ensure that you have entered the correct Jira URL and credentials.\n2. Check the Jira API configuration: Make sure that the Jira API settings are properly configured to allow access from Mattermost. Check if the Jira REST API is enabled and accessible.\n3. Check the Jira application link: Ensure that the application link between Jira and Mattermost is correctly established. If it exists, try removing and recreating the application link to refresh the connection.\n4. Verify Jira user permissions: Ensure that the user account used for the integration has the necessary permissions in Jira to access the REST API and retrieve user information.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, you may need to reach out to the Mattermost support team for further assistance.

Network Connection: Please ensure that your devices have a stable internet connection.\n  2. Docker Settings: Verify if there are any restrictive settings in your docker container configuration that might limit real-time websocket communication.\n  3. Server Logs: Please check the server logs for any potential errors. They may provide more insight into what's causing the delay in message updates.\n\n\n\nIf all these seem fine, am I correct in assuming that this happens for every message you send, irrespective of the channel?

But don't worry, I'm here to assist you on how to fix it.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to help you out:\n\n  1. Log in to your Ubuntu server via SSH using the command: `ssh username@yourserverip`\n\n  2. Check the status of your GitLab and Mattermost services using:\n\n`sudo gitlab-ctl status sudo gitlab-ctl status mattermost`\n\n  3. Since you're using OMNIBUS, the openssl and acme (Let's Encrypt) client is included in the package. You can renew your certificate using:\n\n`sudo gitlab-ctl renew-le-certs`\n\n  4. Once done, check your certificate's status using:\n\n`sudo gitlab-ctl check-config`\n\n  5. If everything checks out without errors, restart Mattermost with:\n\n`sudo gitlab-ctl restart mattermost`\n\nPlease remember to replace \"username\" and \"yourserverip\" with your actual username and server IP respectively in the first step.\n\nI hope these steps will be helpful for you. However, if you encounter any issues along the way, feel free to post back here in more detail and I'd be glad to assist further.\n\nBest,  \n~Mattermost AI Assistant \ud83e\udd16\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

The HTTP-01 challenge is performed by the Let's Encrypt client making a HTTP request on port 80 to your domain. The error being thrown (Invalid response from .well-known/acme-challenge) means the Let's Encrypt server was expected to find a file in the .well-known/acme-challenge directory via HTTP, but it either did not find it or was not accessible.\n\nPlease ensure your domain is pointed to the correct server IP and that your server is accepting requests on port 80. Also, check that your server is allowing the Let's Encrypt servers to complete the HTTP-01 challenge.\n\nFinally, the dpkg error suggests there was an error while installing the GitLab package or perhaps a problem with the package itself. You could attempt to fix this with the following commands:\n\nBash\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n`sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get clean sudo apt-get autoremove sudo dpkg --configure -a sudo apt-get install -f`\n\nAfter running those, try to reinstall GitLab using the command you used before.\n\nPlease try these steps and let me know the results. I'm here to help you resolve the issue!\n\nBest,  \n~Mattermost AI Assistant \ud83e\udd16\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

Now it is at 7.7.1\n- Database Schema Version: 100\n\nHow to reproduce the error: Perhaps it is simply just upgrading from 5.25.0 to 7.7.1 alone, but I cannot say for sure.\n\nExpected behavior\n- I expect my new desktop application and Android app to pick up my existing server URL address and channels.\n\nObserved behavior\n- My desktop application asks me to input server URL and then ask me to create a team. The blue \"< Back\" link at top left does not bring me to a new page.\n- I can click the \"Go to System Console\" when I am being asked to create a team, and then I can click the blue \"< Back to [my existing team before upgrade]\" to see my old teams and chat records.\n- Android app shows \"No teams are available to join\".\n- There are many errors on mattermost.log:\n- \"GetChannelMembersForUserWithPagination: Unable to get the channel members.\"\n- \"Unable to get the teams unread messages.\"\n- \"Unable to get the channels.\"\n- \"Unable to get the channel members.\"\n- \"We could not get all teams.\"\n- \"Unable to get user's Drafts.\"\n- \"Unable to get user threads.\"\n- \"GetThreadsForUser: Unable to get user threads, failed to count urgent mentioned threads for user id=[\u2026]\"\n\nI read 2 posts from this forum, their OP both said they fixed their problem by upgrading version by version.\n- If that is the solution, how may I do that? I am already on 7.7.1.\n- Is there migration MySQL codes that I can simply run on MySQL?",

Did you roll back and are now back on 5.25 or is your Mattermost setup just not working at the moment and you're waiting for a fix?\nThe broken upgrade is most likely caused by the fact that you should have upgraded to 5.37.10 first as mentioned in the Important upgrade notes. When on 5.37.10, you can then directly go to 7.8.0, no further intermediate steps necessary.\n\nIn order to find out what exactly is broken, I would need to see the contents of your `mattermost.log` file. If you followed the default installation instructions, this file should be available under `/opt/mattermost/logs/mattermost.log` - can you share relevant lines from there? Ideally you would watch the file using `tail -f` in a second terminal and restart your Mattermost application server so we can have all the log lines from a fresh server start, that would be awesome.",

After seeing your reply, it inspired me that I can choose each of the next ESR version to upgrade.\n- I wanted to play the safest way, so I upgraded each ESR version starting v6.3.10, and then v7.1.5, and then v7.8.0. Along the way, I fixed database collation conflicts after each upgrade; there are still some error messages in log, but Mattermost's user interface's result seems perfectly predictable and seems working well. Please allow me to create another ticket here to ask questions about my remaining error messages.\n- I would like to suggest an edit on the Upgrade Mattermost Server \u2014 Mattermost documentation page, the step 2 wget line, my 2 cents is it may help readers if there is text to tell readers to choose Enterprise or Team edition to download, because without the \"-team\" value in URL, I think it is default downloading the Enterprise version, and the Upgrade Mattermost Server \u2014 Mattermost documentation session is kind of describing something opposite.\n\nI would like to thank you for your help again.",

It's definitely puzzling when you're expecting to see more users but the next page is empty.\n\nWe're definitely keen on figuring out what exactly is going on here. To further diagnose this, it would be extremely helpful if you could provide a bit more information:\n\n  * Did this issue start happening after an update or was it something you've noticed from the beginning?\n  * Are there any other behaviors that struck you as unusual in the system console?\n  * Do you have error logs generated around the time the issue occurs? If so, could you share the relevant portions with us?\n\nThese details could help us pinpoint the root cause of your issue.\n\nIn the meantime, as a workaround while we're investigating this, you could try using the API to fetch the list of system admins or use the Mattermost CLI to do the same.\n\nThank you for your understanding and patience in this matter.

We are here to help you solve your issue.\n\nThe problem you're experiencing might be related to websockets. Mattermost uses websockets for real-time updates, and it appears that your browser can reach your Mattermost server initially, but cannot maintain the websocket connection.\n\nFirst thing to consider, even if your Mattermost server is set up to be accessed locally, you must ensure that traffic on the port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS is allowed (even though you mentioned you are using HTTP only). Traffic on these ports is necessary for the creation and maintenance of websocket connections.\n\nSecondly, could you check whether your system firewall or security group settings might be preventing websocket connections?\n\nAdditionally, please check that your `config.json` file in the Mattermost directory has the correct SiteURL set. It should match the exact site URL that you are using to access Mattermost (e.g. `\"SiteURL\": \"http://192.168.0.5:8065\"` or `\"SiteURL\": \"http://mattermost.company.local:8065\"`)\n\nLastly, you can access Mattermost logs to get more information about the problem. You can find them in the `logs` folder within the 'mattermost' directory by default.\n\nI hope this information helps get you started on the troubleshooting. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need further assistance.\n\nBest,  \n~Mattermost AI Assistant :robot:\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

I can help you troubleshoot the issue and provide guidance on the correct configuration.\n\nFirst, make sure that your Mattermost server is reachable and functioning properly without HAProxy. You can verify this by accessing Mattermost directly using the server's IP address and port (e.g., http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8065). If Mattermost is working fine, the issue is likely with your HAProxy configuration.\n\nTo enable WebSocket support in HAProxy, you need to add the `http-server-close` option and the `http-protocol-tunnel` option to your backend configuration. Here's an updated snippet for your Mattermost config in HAProxy:\n\n# Mattermost\nacl mattermost_req hdr(host) -i mattermost.example.com\nacl mattermost_req hdr(Upgrade) -i websocket\nacl mattermost_req hdr_beg(Host) -i ws.\nuse_backend mattermost if mattermost_req\n\n# Mattermost\nbackend mattermost\n  mode http\n  option forwardfor header X-Real-IP\n  http-request set-header X-Real-IP %[src]\n  option http-server-close\n  option http-protocol-tunnel\n  server docker01 xx.xx.xx.xx:8065 alpn http/1.1\n\nAfter making these changes, restart HAProxy and try accessing Mattermost again through the reverse proxy. This configuration should enable WebSocket support and allow the WebSocket connection to be established.\n\nIf the issue persists, please provide any relevant error logs or error messages you are seeing, as they will help in further troubleshooting the problem.\n\nLet me know if this helps!\n\nBest regards,\n~Matterbot 2.0 \ud83e\udd16\n\n[Disclaimer: This was an AI assisted response powered by ChatGPT.

As of the current implementation in Mattermost, yes, the `getPostsForChannel` method retrieves historical messages directly from the database without utilizing a caching layer.\n\nThis is designed to ensure message accuracy and integrity by pulling directly from the primary data source. While this choice comes with trade-offs - like potentially increased latency for large, remote, or complex databases - Mattermost has prioritized data consistency and accuracy.\n\nHowever, it's important to underline that Mattermost is continually evolving, and optimizations including potential caching mechanisms could be implemented in future updates depending on various factors such as use-cases, user feedback, and performance metrics.\n\nI hope this answers your question!

To handle form submissions from an interactive dialog, you generally want to set up a separate endpoint in your Django application to process the POST request that's sent when the dialog is submitted.\n\nThe `submit_dialog` request, upon interactions like a user submitting the dialog or dropdown select, sends a `POST` request to the `callback_url` that you specified when opening the dialog.\n\nHere's a short example in pseudo code -\n\nWhen you open the dialog, you define a `dialog` object like so:\n\nPython\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n\n`dialog = { \"callback_id\": \"somecallbackid\", \"url\": \"https://your-django-app.com/process-dialog\", \"title\": \"Dialog Title\", \"elements\": [ { \"type\": \"text\", \"name\": \"input_field_1\", \"label\": \"Input Field 1\", }, ], \"submit_label\": \"Submit\", \"notify_on_cancel\": False, }`\n\nNotice the `url` field in dialog, that's where you'd put the endpoint in your Django application that you want Mattermost to send the POST request to when the dialog is submitted.\n\nThen in your Django app, handle this at the endpoint `process-dialog`:\n\nPython\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23\n\n`@require_POST  \ndef process_dialog(request):  \npayload = json.loads(request.body)  \nsubmitted_data = payload['submission']\n    \n    \n    # Now you have access to the submitted data. \n    # i.e - If your dialog had a field with the name \"input_field_1\", \n    # you can access its submitted value by - field_1_value = submitted_data['input_field_1']\n    \n    # You can then do any processing you need with the submitted data.\n    \n    # To send a message back to the channel you can use the 'response_url' provided in the payload.\n    # This will execute a POST request to the response_url and send the specified message to the channel.\n    \n    response_message = {\n        \"response_type\": \"in_channel\",\n        \"text\": f\"You submitted: {field_1_value}\"\n    }\n    \n    headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}\n    requests.post(payload['response_url'], headers=headers, data=json.dumps(response_message))\n    \n    return HttpResponse(status=200) # Respond with a 200 OK.`\n    \n\nThat's it! Before integrating it, please replace the placeholder URL with your actual application's endpoint. I hope the above example helps you to move forward.\n\nJust remember, the values you're capturing in the dialog can be accessed in the payload of the POST request sent to the callback URL that you've defined.\n\nIf you have more questions or run into any issues, feel free to ask.

This error message typically occurs when the application hasn't been set up correctly in Azure, or if the client and tenant IDs used aren't aligned with an application in Azure AD.\n\nLet's try a few things to troubleshoot this:\n\n  1. **Double-check the Application Registration in Azure AD** : Navigate to the Azure portal > Azure Active Directory > App registrations. Here, confirm that the application is indeed listed and that its Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID match with what you have input in Mattermost.\n\n  2. **Double-check Application's API permissions** : Make sure the required API permissions are set up correctly for the app according to the instructions in the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-msteams-sync/blob/main/docs/azure_setup.md).\n\n  3. **Confirm administrator consent** : For some permissions, the admin must explicitly grant consent. You can do this by navigating to: Azure portal > Azure Active Directory > App registrations > Your registered app > API permissions > Grant admin consent.\n\n  4. **Verify the Application Secret** : If there's a discrepancy between the client secret in Azure AD and what you've input in Mattermost, you'd encounter an issue. Make sure both these values are consistent.\n\n\n\n\nPlease give these steps a try and let me know how it goes.

It sounds like your Mattermost server works well locally but has problems with remote calls.\n\nThere are a few things that might be causing this problem. Based on the errors you've provided, it seems like there might be a problem related to the networking configuration, possibly a connectivity issue between the calling parties when outside the local network. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot:\n\n  1. **Check Network Configuration:** Ensure that all required ports (especially those related to WebRTC which is used for calls) are correctly opened and forwarded in your network configuration. There's a chance that the calls are not correctly passing through your network due to restrictive network settings.\n\n  2. **NGINX Reverse Proxy:** Verify the configuration of your nginx reverse proxy. It should correctly forward the Mattermost server's WebRTC signals. Make sure it is configured as per the [official Mattermost NGINX configuration documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/install/config-proxy-nginx.html).\n\n  3. **Check Plugin Version:** Please make sure you're using the latest version of `com.mattermost.calls` plugin. If not, upgrading to the latest version might help solve these errors.\n\n  4. **Logs:** If possible, provide the full Mattermost server logs from the timeframe around when an unsuccessful call is made. This could provide further insights into any unforeseen issues.\n\n\n\n\nIf you run through these steps and are still experiencing issues, don't hesitate to provide us with the results and we'll be more than happy to assist you further.\n\nWarm Regards,\n\n~Mattermost AI Assistant ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by Mattermost AI.

Changing these permissions directly from the shell may not work, as Mattermost enforces the 600 mode on new files created.\n\nHowever, you can use Access Control Lists (ACLs) to provide additional permissions to specific users or groups without changing the default file permissions. ACLs allow for more granular control over file access.\n\nTo enable ACLs on the file system, you need to ensure that your filesystem supports ACLs and that it is mounted with the `acl` option. You can check if ACLs are enabled by running the command `mount` and looking for the presence of the `acl` option in the output.\n\nOnce ACLs are enabled, you can use the `setfacl` command to modify the permissions for specific files or directories. For example, you can grant read access to the backup user while preserving the existing permissions for the mattermost user. Here's an example command:\n\n```\nsudo setfacl -m u:backupuser:r /path/to/mattermost/data/file.txt\n```\n\nThis command grants read (`r`) access to the user `backupuser` for the specified file. You can adjust the command based on your requirements and apply it to the necessary files or directories.\n\nKeep in mind that using ACLs adds an additional layer of complexity, so it's important to understand the implications and ensure proper configuration and maintenance.\n\nBest regards,\n~Matterbot 2.0 \ud83e\udd16\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This is a new AI response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

The Mattermost documentation does not currently provide a comprehensive list of all available action types for interactive messages, nor the different options/properties they can accept. However, I can still provide you with some information that might be helpful.\n\nRegarding your questions:\n\na) Yes, the response to an interactive message button can add to the existing message rather than overwriting it. You can use the update API call to update the original message with the new content you want to add.\n\nb) As of now, Mattermost does not have a built-in action type for multiselect in interactive messages. However, you can achieve similar functionality by using the select action type and allowing users to select multiple options by holding down the Ctrl (or Command) key while making their selections.\n\nWhile the interactive message documentation is limited, you can find some examples and additional guidance in the Mattermost GitHub repository's sample apps. These sample apps showcase different use cases and can provide insights into how to create and consume interactive messages programmatically.\n\nI apologize for any inconvenience caused by the lack of comprehensive documentation on this topic. If you have any further questions or need assistance with any specific use case, please let me know, and I'll do my best to help you!\n\nBest regards,\n~Matterbot 2.0 ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This is a beta AI assisted response powered by ChatGPT.

Let's go through them one by one:\n\n  1. Error in Mattermost console log: The warning message you received indicates that Mattermost failed to get the public IP address for the local interface. This warning is typically harmless and shouldn't cause any major issues.\n  2. Error in ChatGPT console log: The error message suggests that the ChatGPT bot is receiving an invalid response from the Mattermost server. This could be due to incorrect configuration or connectivity issues between the bot and the Mattermost server. Here are a few things to check:\n\n\n  * Ensure that the `MATTERMOST_URL` environment variable in your `chatgpt-bot` service is set correctly. It should match the URL where Mattermost is accessible.\n  * Verify that the `MATTERMOST_TOKEN` environment variable is set correctly. It should contain a valid token for the bot user in Mattermost.\n  * Check if there are any network or firewall restrictions that might be preventing the bot from connecting to the Mattermost server.\n\n\n  3. Missing configuration: From the provided stack file, it seems that you haven't defined the networks section. It's recommended to define a network for your services to ensure proper communication between them. Add the following section to your stack file:\n\n\n    \n    \n    networks:\n      - mattermost-net\n    \n\nThen, update the `services` section of each service to include the network configuration:\n    \n    \n    services:\n      mattermost:\n        networks:\n          - mattermost-net\n        ...\n      db:\n        networks:\n          - mattermost-net\n        ...\n      chatgpt-bot:\n        networks:\n          - mattermost-net\n        ...\n    \n\nFinally, add the following section at the end of the stack file to define the network:\n    \n    \n    networks:\n      mattermost-net:\n    \n\nMake sure to apply these changes to your stack file, and then redeploy the stack using Docker Compose. This should help resolve the issues you're facing.

                "message_content": "Heya Alexander,\n\nWelcome back to the forums!\n\nUpgrading Mattermost to the latest version and migrating the MySQL database is indeed a feasible method. Here are the general steps you can follow:\n\n1. Set up a new server: Install Ubuntu 22.04 on the new server and ensure it meets the hardware requirements for Mattermost. You can refer to the Ubuntu documentation for installation instructions.\n2. Install and configure MySQL: Install MySQL Server 8.0.34 on the new server and configure it according to your needs. You can refer to the MySQL documentation for installation and configuration instructions.\n3. Install the latest version of Mattermost: Follow the Mattermost installation guide for Ubuntu ([Redirect](https://docs.mattermost.com/install/install-ubuntu-1804.html)) to install the latest version on the new server. Make sure to follow the instructions specific to Ubuntu 22.04.\n4. Migrate the MySQL database: Once you have the latest version of Mattermost installed, you can migrate the MySQL database from the old server to the new server. You can use the mysqldump command on the old server to export the database, then import it on the new server using the mysql command. Here is an example of how to export and import the database:\n\nOn the old server:\n\n```\nmysqldump -u <username> -p <databasename> > mattermost.sql\n```\n\nOn the new server:\n\n```\nmysql -u <username> -p <databasename> < mattermost.sql\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `<username>`, `<databasename>`, and `mattermost.sql` with appropriate values.\n5. Verify the migration and upgrade: Start the Mattermost server on the new server and ensure everything is working correctly. Verify that all users, channels, and messages are available in the new version. Test the functionality to ensure a successful migration.\n\nRegarding your question about deploying Mattermost with Omnibus, it is a recommended method for simplifying setup and maintenance, especially if you're running the server and database on a single system. However, it's not mandatory, and you can choose the method that suits your requirements and infrastructure.\n\nIf you encounter any issues during the process, feel free to ask for further assistance!\n\nBest regards,\n~Matterbot 2.0 ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by ChatGPT.

Here are a few steps you can try:\n\n1. Confirm that Mattermost is bound to the correct IP address: Check your Mattermost configuration file (`config.json`) and ensure that the `ListenAddress` is set to `\"0.0.0.0:8070\"` instead of `\"localhost:8070\"`. This will make sure it listens on all available network interfaces.\n2. Check firewall settings: Although you mentioned that your firewall is disabled, it's worth double-checking. Temporarily enable the firewall and make sure port 8070 is open for incoming connections.\n3. Verify network connectivity: Ensure that your Ubuntu machine's IP address is indeed `192.168.202.181` by running the `ifconfig` command in the terminal. Also, make sure you can access other services (e.g., web servers) running on the same IP address.\n4. Check if the port is accessible: From another machine on the same local network, try accessing `http://192.168.202.181:8070/` using a web browser. If it fails, there might be an issue with network settings, such as a router configuration or network isolation.\n5. Verify Mattermost site URL: Confirm that the `SiteURL` setting in the `config.json` file is set to `\"http://192.168.202.181:8070/\"`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue preventing Mattermost from running on your local IP address. Let me know if you need further assistance!\n\nBest regards,\n~Matterbot 2.0 \ud83e\udd16\n\n[**Disclaimer:** This was an AI assisted response powered by ChatGPT.

We connect via desktop and mobile, and access via reverse proxy and LetsEncrypt cert.\n\nThrough that time, we've had one staff member in particular who has been having a lot of issues (many times a day, basically unusable) on the mobile app, with \"The Server is Not Reachable\" error message, and red (i) icon for messages that aren't sending. We have one other staff member who has a similar problem, but far less frequently. Two other staff members have no problems.\n\nWe are running v8.1.2 MM, and the most current mobile apps (all android). This has been happening since when we first launched MM (which was a v7).\n\nIt doesn't seem like the staff members that are having problems have any VPN or unusual DNS settings on their mobile devices. Both staff members who are having some issues are using Samsung phones. The staff members who aren't having issues are using OnePlus & Essential devices.\n\nIn terms of resolving the issue temporarily, sometimes flipping airplane mode on and off helps.\n\nI've tried searching out solutions, as well as other people having similar issues, and didn't get anywhere unfortunately. Any thoughts or help would be much appreciated. Thanks!",

Here are a few suggestions:\n\n  1. **Check network connectivity** : Ensure that the affected staff members have a stable internet connection on their mobile devices. You can ask them to try accessing other websites or applications to see if they encounter any network-related issues.\n  2. **Update the Mattermost server** : Make sure your Mattermost server is up to date. Check if there are any available updates for the server, and if so, consider upgrading to the latest version. This could potentially resolve any known issues related to mobile connectivity.\n  3. **Verify mobile app configuration** : Double-check the configuration settings on the mobile app for the affected staff members. Ensure that the server URL is correct, and that there are no typos or missing characters. Also, confirm that the app is set to use the appropriate port and protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) for your setup.\n  4. **Restart the Mattermost server** : Try restarting the Mattermost server running on your Synology NAS. Sometimes, a simple server restart can resolve temporary connectivity issues.\n  5. **Check firewall or network restrictions** : Verify that there are no firewall rules or network restrictions blocking the mobile app's access to the Mattermost server. Check if any network settings or firewall configurations have changed recently.\n  6. **Review server logs** : Check the Mattermost server logs to see if there are any error messages or warnings related to the mobile connectivity issues. The logs might provide more insight into the root cause of the problem.\n\nIf none of these suggestions resolve the issue, please provide more details about your setup, such as the reverse proxy configuration, any recent changes to your environment, or any other relevant information. This will help us in further diagnosing the problem and finding a solution.\n\nBest regards,  \n~Matterbot 2.0 \n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This is a beta AI assisted response powered by ChatGPT.

When we call from within the network, everything works great, however the above issue happens when calling from outside of the local network, whether via computer or mobile app.\nOur network is managed through an instance of NGINX. I read on another forum posting about compatibility issues with NGINX, however it's running on the same server instance as the Gitlab/Mattermost container. Here is the port forwarding config from the container:\n[Image of port forwarding config]\n\nI had initially tried forwarding 8443 to 443, but that didn't work either.\nHere is the NGINX config for Mattermost:\n[NGINX config code]\n\nI've read through this topic here and tried a few different things, but without any luck:\n[Reference to another forum topic]\n\nCan anyone give me any suggestions? All the traffic needs to be routed through NGINX as per our config, so there's no way we can bypass that and go straight to Mattermost.\nAny help would be appreciated!\nThanks.",

Ensure that the \"Team Member\" role has the \"Can mention all team members\" permission enabled.\n2. Team Settings: Double-check the team settings to confirm that the \"Enable user mention autocomplete\" option is enabled. You can find this setting in the \"Team Settings\" under \"Permissions.\"\n3. Cache Refresh: Clear your browser cache and refresh the page. Sometimes, caching issues can cause unexpected behavior.\n4. Mattermost and Boards Versions: Ensure that you have the latest versions of Mattermost (7.8.6) and Boards (7.10.0). Updating to the latest versions may resolve any known issues or bugs.\n\nIf the issue persists after trying these steps, it would be helpful to gather more information. Please check the Mattermost server logs for any related errors or warnings.\n\nI hope this helps!

In Mattermost, role permissions and settings might vary depending on the setup and configuration, and some of the current information within Matterbot 2.0 appears to be a little bit outdated. Here's a more general guide to finding these settings:\n\n1. Team Member Role Permissions: To locate the permissions for the \"Team Member\" role, you can navigate to your Mattermost System Console. Go to the \"System Console\" by clicking on the menu in the top-left corner and selecting \"System Console.\" Then, under the \"Users and Teams\" section, click on \"Permissions.\" Look for the \"Team Member\" role in the list and make sure it has the \"Can mention all team members\" permission enabled.\n2. Enable User Mention Autocomplete: To find the \"Enable user mention autocomplete\" option, navigate to the specific team where the issue is occurring. Click on the three-dot menu next to the team name and select \"Team Settings.\" From there, go to the \"Permissions\" tab and scroll down to find the \"Enable user mention autocomplete\" option. Ensure it is enabled.\n\nIf you have already confirmed that these settings are correctly configured and the issue persists, it might be worth considering some additional troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. Server Logs: Check the Mattermost server logs for any specific errors or warnings related to the user mention autocomplete issue. You can access the server logs by logging into your Mattermost server and examining the logs in the file system or using the Mattermost CLI command `mattermost log view`.\n2. Support Channels: If the problem persists and you're unable to find a solution, I recommend reaching out to the Mattermost support team directly. They can provide more in-depth assistance and investigate the issue further. You can reach out to them through the Mattermost Support Portal or by emailing support@mattermost.com.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.",

Let's try to troubleshoot the issue together. Here are a few steps we can take:\n\n1. Make sure you have the latest version of the Docker Compose file. You can get the latest version from the Mattermost GitHub repository: [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)\n2. Before running the upgrade command, ensure that you are in the correct directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located.\n3. Double-check that you've made the changes to the `docker-compose.yml` file correctly. In your case, you should set the `MATTERMOST_IMAGE_TAG` to the desired version, such as `7.8`. Confirm that you saved the file after making the changes.\n4. Run the following command to perform the upgrade:\n\n```\nsudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.without-nginx.yml pull\nsudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.without-nginx.yml up -d\n```\n\nEnsure that the commands are executed in the same directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located. This will pull the latest image and recreate the containers.\n\n5. After the upgrade process completes, you can check the version by running the following command:\n\n```\nsudo docker exec -it mattermost app version\n```\n\nMake sure the version displayed matches the one you intended to upgrade to.\n\nIf you're still experiencing issues after following these steps, please let me know, and I'll do my best to assist you further.\n\nBest regards,\n~Matterbot 2.0 ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This is a beta AI assisted response powered by ChatGPT.

Locate the configuration file for Mattermost Desktop. The location varies depending on your operating system:\n\n* Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Mattermost\\config.json`\n* macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Mattermost/config.json`\n* Linux: `~/.config/Mattermost/config.json`\n\n2. Open the `config.json` file in a text editor.\n3. Look for the `\"AutoUpdateCheckEnabled\"` setting. By default, it is set to `true`, enabling automatic update checks. To disable automatic update checks, change the value to `false`.\n4. Save the `config.json` file.\n\nBy setting `\"AutoUpdateCheckEnabled\": false`, you disable the automatic update check for all your Mattermost Desktop clients. Please note that this change needs to be applied to each client individually or through a centralized configuration management tool on your clients.\n\nIf you have any further questions, feel free to ask!\n\nBest regards,\n~Matterbot 2.0 ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This is a beta AI assisted response powered by ChatGPT.

Allow me to clarify:\n\nWhile the mattermost-redux package is no longer actively maintained as a separate package, you don't need to download the entire mattermost-webapp project and copy the redux part to your project.\n\nInstead, you can directly use the Redux part from the mattermost-webapp project by installing it as a dependency in your own project. This way, you'll be able to benefit from any updates or improvements made to the Redux implementation in mattermost-webapp.\n\nTo do this, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Install the mattermost-redux package as a dependency in your project:\n\n\n    \n    \n    npm install @mattermost-redux/core\n    \n\n  2. Import and use the Redux functionality from the installed package in your project:\n\n\n    \n    \n    import { createStore } from '@mattermost-redux/core';\n    \n    // Example usage\n    const store = createStore(...);\n    \n\nBy using the `@mattermost-redux/core` package, you can integrate the Redux part of Mattermost into your project without the need to copy it from the mattermost-webapp project.\n\nI hope this clears up the confusion.

The error message you mentioned, \"Seeker can't seek,\" typically occurs when there is an issue with accessing or seeking the location of the image files.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, here are a few steps you can try:\n\n  1. Clear your browser cache: Sometimes, browser cache can cause issues with loading images. Clearing the cache may help resolve the problem. You can find instructions on how to clear the cache for different browsers in their respective documentation.\n  2. Verify the file path: Ensure that the image files are located in the correct directory and that the file paths in your Mattermost configuration are accurate. Double-check the configuration files to confirm that the image storage settings are properly configured.\n  3. Check file permissions: Ensure that the file permissions for the image files and directories are correctly set, allowing the Mattermost application to access and preview the images. Make sure that the user running the Mattermost server has appropriate read/write permissions.\n  4. Review your reverse proxy configuration: If you are using a reverse proxy, check its configuration to ensure that it is properly configured to handle image requests. Verify that the proxy settings are correctly forwarding requests to the Mattermost server.\n  5. Restart Mattermost: Sometimes, a simple restart of the Mattermost server can resolve the issue. Restart the Mattermost service and see if the image previews start working again.\n\n\n\nIf the issue persists after trying these steps, please provide more details about your Mattermost setup, such as the operating system, database, reverse proxy (if any), and any error logs you have encountered. This information will help further troubleshoot the issue and provide more specific guidance.\n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance!\n\nBest regards,  \n~Matterbot 2.0 ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This is a beta AI assisted response powered by ChatGPT.

Once you have identified the container, use the following command to stop it: `docker stop <container_id>` (replace `<container_id>` with the actual ID or name of your Mattermost container).\n\nStopping the container will gracefully shut down the Mattermost application, ensuring data consistency during the backup process. Make sure to verify that the container has indeed stopped by running `docker ps` again and ensuring that the Mattermost container is no longer listed.\n\nRemember, taking a backup is always a critical operation, so it's essential to double-check your steps and ensure you have a reliable backup strategy in place.

I understand that you have been using the TE and would like to continue doing so while simplifying your upgrade process by using the deb packages. Allow me to provide some clarification.\n\nThe recent changes you observed are not intentional planned obsolescence of the TE in favor of a single EE with a free plan. The deb packages are primarily intended for the enterprise edition, but they can also be used for the team edition. However, the default configuration of the deb packages is set to the enterprise edition.\n\nTo continue using the team edition with the deb packages, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Install the deb packages using the standard installation process.\n2. After installation, you can manually change the edition setting from \"ee\" to \"te\" in the `config.json` file located in the Mattermost configuration directory.\n3. Restart the Mattermost server to apply the changes.\n\nBy modifying the `config.json` file, you can ensure that the Mattermost server continues to run as the team edition.\n\nPlease note that this change may affect some features and functionality that are exclusive to the enterprise edition.

You're correct that there is no configuration key in the config.json file specifically related to the edition (team or enterprise). I apologize for the incorrect information provided.\n\nRegarding your assumption that there is no easy way to effectively downgrade from EE to TE after using the deb packages, I do believe that is correct as well. Once you have installed and configured Mattermost with the enterprise edition, it is not straightforward to switch to the team edition. I believe it would require a separate installation of the team edition and migrating the data.\n\nIn terms of functionality, the team edition and the enterprise edition are functionally equivalent for most features. However, there are some additional features and functionality available in the enterprise edition that are not present in the team edition. These additional features are typically aimed at larger organizations with specific enterprise requirements.\n\nIf you find it easier to manage Mattermost using the deb packages and don't require the enterprise-specific features, there is no real downside to using the EE-free edition for the ease of administration. The EE-free edition provides a free plan that includes most of the enterprise edition features, making it a suitable choice for many organizations.\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with or if you have any further questions!",

                "message_content": "Hi HLo! Welcome to the Mattermost Community forums.\n\nI understand that you're having trouble configuring Mattermost with pfSense and HAProxy. Let's troubleshoot the issue step by step.\n\nFirst, ensure that Mattermost is running and accessible on the specified address and port (192.168.100.22:8065). You can test this by accessing Mattermost directly using the internal IP address from a browser within your network. If it's not accessible, make sure Mattermost is properly installed and running.\n\nNext, let's verify the HAProxy configuration:\n\n  1. Check if the ACL for Mattermost is correctly configured. Ensure that the ACL expression matches the subdomain correctly. In your case, it should be \"host starts with mattermost.domain.com\".\n  2. Verify that the backend configuration for Mattermost is accurate. Double-check the backend address (192.168.100.22:8065) and make sure it matches the address and port where Mattermost is running.\n  3. Ensure that the SSL offloading option is checked in the front-end configuration. This allows HAProxy to handle the SSL/TLS encryption.\n  4. Confirm that the WebSocket port for Mattermost is correctly configured. It should be set to the same port used for HTTP traffic (8065 in your case).\n  5. Check that the certificate selected in the front-end configuration is valid for the Mattermost domain (mattermost.domain.com).\n  6. If you're using ACME to manage certificates, ensure that the certificate for Mattermost is successfully obtained and renewed.\n\n\n\nAfter verifying these configurations, try accessing Mattermost using the domain (mattermost.domain.com) from a browser outside your network. If you still encounter issues, check the following:\n\n  * Ensure that the necessary ports (443 for HTTPS and the WebSocket port) are open in your pfSense firewall and forwarded to the HAProxy server.\n  * Verify that there are no additional network-level restrictions or firewalls blocking the traffic.\n\n\n\nIf you're still experiencing issues, please provide any relevant error logs or messages so that I can assist you further.\n\nBest regards,  \n~Matterbot 2.0 \n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This is a beta AI assisted response powered by ChatGPT.

The missing button could be related to the configuration of your Mattermost instance. Here are a few things you can check and try to resolve the issue:\n\n  1. Verify WebSocket Configuration: Make sure that the WebSocket configuration is properly set up in your Mattermost server. WebSocket is required for the \"Start Calls\" functionality. You can check the `WebSocketURL` setting in your `config.json` file to ensure it's correctly configured.\n  2. Check Browser Compatibility: Ensure that you are using a supported browser for Mattermost calls. Mattermost currently supports the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox. If you're using an unsupported browser, try switching to a supported one and see if the button appears.\n  3. Check Network Configuration: Verify that your network configuration allows WebSocket connections. Some corporate networks or firewall configurations may block WebSocket connections, which could result in the \"Start Calls\" button not being displayed. You can try accessing Mattermost from a different network or contact your network administrator to check if WebSocket connections are allowed.\n  4. Clear Browser Cache: Clear your browser cache and refresh the Mattermost page. Sometimes, outdated or corrupted cached files can cause issues with the user interface.\n\nIf none of the above steps resolve the issue, I recommend reaching out to the Mattermost support team or posting your question in the Mattermost community forum.

I followed your suggestions and Mattermost itself seem to work fine.\n\nBut there are some smaller problems I see with the approach. Aftern installing Mattermost for the first time ansible will start nginx using port 80. In order to server port 80 with another web server (in our case apache2) I have to stop the service, then start the other web server. When updating Mattermost ansible will try to (re)start nginx again, but will fail, because port 80 is already in use.\n\nI think for institutions like our it department it would be a great improvement, when the Mattermost Omnibus package would support the use of your own certificate. The playbook already loads configuration from `/etc/mattermost/mmomni.yml`. I think it should be possible to use `ssl_certificate_key` and `ssl_certificate` as variables here and change the playbook slightly in order to make the certificates customizable and the certbot optional.\n\nI had a look around where I could suggest this feature, or even provide a pull-request, but I'm not sure where to do so.

To address this problem, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Upgrade to the latest version: Ensure that you are running the latest version of Mattermost, as newer versions often include bug fixes and performance improvements that could help with this issue.\n2. Adjust server settings: You can try adjusting the server settings to optimize performance for users with a large number of dialogs. In particular, you may want to review the `MaxUsersPerTeam` and `MaxChannelsPerTeam` settings in your Mattermost server configuration.\n3. Use alternative clients: Mattermost provides an official web client, desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as mobile apps for iOS and Android. If the official client is causing issues, you can try using alternative clients like Matterhorn, Rambox, or Franz, which support the Mattermost API.\n4. Custom development: If none of the above options work for you, you can consider building your own custom client using the Mattermost API. This would give you more control over the client and allow you to tailor it to your specific needs.\n\nI recommend starting with the first two options and seeing if they help resolve the issue. If not, you can explore alternative clients or custom development. Let me know if you need further assistance or if there's anything else I can help you with!\n\nBest regards,\n~Matterbot 2.0 ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This is a beta AI assisted response powered by ChatGPT.

Specifically, it seems that the audience (aud) parameter is incorrect or doesn't match the expected value.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Double-check the Jira configuration: Ensure that the Jira base URL and OAuth configuration are correctly set up in Mattermost. Make sure the Jira base URL matches the one used in your Jira environment.\n2. Verify the OAuth 2.0 configuration: Check the OAuth 2.0 configuration in Jira and ensure that the audience (aud) parameter is set to the correct value. It should be set to the URL of your Mattermost instance.\n3. Regenerate OAuth credentials: If the issue persists, try regenerating the OAuth credentials in Jira and updating them in Mattermost. This process can help ensure that the credentials are valid and match between the two systems.\n\nIf you've followed these steps and are still experiencing the issue, I recommend reaching out to the Mattermost support team or the Jira plugin's support channels for further assistance. They will be able to investigate the issue more closely and provide you with specific guidance tailored to your setup.\n\nBest regards,\n~Matterbot 2.0 ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This is a beta AI assisted response powered by ChatGPT.

Focalboard won't start.\n\n**What (might) be wrong?**  \nThe file \"focalboard.db\" (located in documents/focalboard) changed the minute after I tried to start the new version.

However, I do not see that starting the new version of focalboard changed the file.  \nI tried to delete the documents\\focalboard folder and replaced the focalboard.db with the old one, which includes all of my projects.

Let's try to troubleshoot the issue together.\n\nHere are a few steps you can follow:\n\n  1. Double-check the HTTPS URL: Ensure that you're using the correct HTTPS URL to access your Mattermost instance on your iPhone. Make sure it matches the URL you use on the web app and desktop app.\n  2. Verify the certificate installation: Confirm that the self-signed certificate is correctly installed on your iPhone. You mentioned that you have already installed the certificate, but it's worth double-checking if it's installed correctly. You can go to Settings > General > About > Certificate Trust Settings to verify if the certificate is trusted.\n  3. Clear app data: Try clearing the data of the Mattermost app on your iPhone. Go to Settings > Mattermost > Clear Data. Then restart the app and try logging in again.\n  4. Check certificate validity: Ensure that the self-signed certificate is valid and has not expired. Check the certificate's expiration date and make sure it's still valid.\n  5. Verify server configuration: Confirm that the Mattermost server is correctly configured to use the HTTPS protocol. Check the Mattermost server logs for any errors or warnings related to HTTPS configuration.\n\n\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, I recommend reaching out to the Mattermost community forum or contacting the Mattermost support team for further assistance. They will be able to provide more specific guidance based on your setup.\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!\n\nBest regards,  \n~Matterbot 2.0 ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This is a new AI response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

Mattermost is not limited to certain operating systems. It is a platform-agnostic collaboration tool that can be used on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Additionally, there are mobile apps available for iOS and Android.\n  2. Developers are not required to charge a minimum price within the Mattermost Marketplace. They have the flexibility to set their own pricing for their apps.\n  3. Similarly, developers are not required to charge a maximum price for their apps. They can choose the price that they believe is fair for their offerings.\n  4. Free tiers of Mattermost do not entitle developers to offer free apps. Developers can still charge for their apps, even for instances using the free tier of Mattermost.\n  5. The commission structure for paid apps on the Mattermost Marketplace is a revenue share of 70% to the developer and 30% to Mattermost. This commission structure remains the same across all tiers.\n  6. The marketplace supports multiple currencies. Developers can choose the currency in which they want to sell their apps.\n  7. App licenses on the Mattermost Marketplace are not based on the number of seats, power users, or total active users. Developers typically offer their apps at a flat rate, allowing customers to install and use the app on their Mattermost instances without any limitations on the number of users.\n\n\n\nI hope this answers your questions.

I've been following the instructions outlined in the official documentation: [Configure TLS on Mattermost server \u2014 Mattermost documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/install/config-tls-mattermost.html).\n\nOne of the essential steps in this process involves executing the command:\n\n`sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep /opt/mattermost/bin/mattermost`\n\nHowever, since I'm using the Docker version of Mattermost (mattermost/mattermost-team-edition:8.1.0), I'm facing a slight challenge in applying this step.\n\nI would greatly appreciate it if someone could guide me on how to achieve the equivalent configuration within the Docker setup.\n\nAdditionally, I'm curious to know if it's feasible to run Mattermost over HTTPS without the necessity of a domain. I've observed that it functions adequately over HTTP using my IP address.\n\nThank you in advance for your assistance.",

                "message_content": "Hello Yiru Chen! To configure Mattermost to operate over a secure HTTPS connection within a Docker environment, there are a few steps you can follow:\n\n  1. First, make sure you have a valid SSL certificate and private key for your domain. You can obtain one from a trusted certificate authority or use a self-signed certificate for testing purposes.\n  2. In your Docker Compose file or Docker command, you need to expose port 443 for HTTPS traffic. Add the following line to the Mattermost service definition:\n\n\n    \n    \n    ports:\n      - 443:443\n    \n\n  3. Mount the SSL certificate and private key files into the Docker container. Add the following lines to the Mattermost service definition:\n\n\n    \n    \n    volumes:\n      - /path/to/ssl/certificate:/etc/mattermost/cert/cert.pem\n      - /path/to/ssl/private/key:/etc/mattermost/cert/key.pem\n    \n\nReplace `/path/to/ssl/certificate` and `/path/to/ssl/private/key` with the actual paths to your SSL certificate and private key files.  \n4\\. Set the `ServiceSettings.ListenAddress` configuration in your `config.json` file to `:443`. This will make Mattermost listen on port 443 for HTTPS traffic. You can mount your custom `config.json` file into the container using a volume.If you don't have a custom `config.json` file, you can create one with the following contents:\n    \n    \n    {\n      \"ServiceSettings\": {\n        \"ListenAddress\": \":443\"\n      }\n    }\n    \n\n  5. Restart your Mattermost Docker container for the changes to take effect.\n\n\n\nRegarding your second question, it is indeed possible to run Mattermost over HTTPS without a domain. You can use your IP address instead. However, keep in mind that using an IP address might cause issues with SSL certificate validation if the certificate is issued for a domain. Therefore, it's recommended to use a domain with a valid SSL certificate for production deployments.\n\nI hope this helps you with configuring Mattermost over HTTPS in your Docker setup. Let me know if you have any further questions!\n\nBest regards,  \n~Matterbot 2.0 ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This is a new AI response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

The error message you mentioned, \"Failed to connect to localhost port 8065 after 0 ms: Connection refused,\" indicates that the container is having trouble establishing a connection on port 8065.\n\nTo resolve this issue, there are a few steps you can follow:\n\n  1. Check if the Mattermost container is running: Run the command `docker ps` to verify that the Mattermost container is up and running. Make sure the container is healthy and running without any issues.\n  2. Verify the port mapping: Ensure that the port mapping for the Mattermost service is correctly set in your Docker Compose file or Docker command. Double-check that you have the line `ports: - 8065:8065` or `ports: - 443:8065` (if using HTTPS) in your Mattermost service definition.\n  3. Confirm the container's network configuration: Check if the container is running in the same network as your other services. If you're using Docker Compose, ensure that all the services are defined within the same network block.\n  4. Verify the Mattermost configuration: Review your Mattermost configuration file (config.json) and make sure the `ServiceSettings.ListenAddress` is correctly set to `:8065` or `:443` (if using HTTPS) to ensure the container is listening on the correct port.\n  5. Check if any firewall rules are blocking the connection: Ensure that there are no firewall rules on your host machine or network that could be blocking the connection on port 8065 or 443. You may need to allow incoming connections on those ports.\n  6. Review the container logs: Check the container logs for any error messages or warnings that could provide more insight into the issue. You can use the command `docker logs <container_name>` to view the logs of a specific container.\n\n\n\nRegarding your comment about setting `UseLetsEncrypt` to true and not mounting the certificate files into the Docker container, please note that if you're using Let's Encrypt, the SSL certificate files should still be mounted into the container. The `UseLetsEncrypt` configuration option enables automatic SSL certificate retrieval and renewal, but the certificate files still need to be accessible within the container.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you troubleshoot the issue with your Mattermost Docker container.

Thanks for reaching out, and welcome to the Mattermost Community Forums!\n\nI apologize for the frustration you're experiencing with changing the site URL in Mattermost. To change the site URL when using the Mattermost omnibus on Ubuntu, you can modify the environment variable `MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL` through the command line. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Access your Mattermost server via SSH or open a terminal session.\n2. Run the following command to edit the Mattermost service environment file:\n\n```\nsudo nano /etc/mattermost/mattermost.env\n```\n\n3. Look for the line that starts with `MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL` and modify it to your desired URL. For example:\n\n```\nMM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=https://your-new-url.com\n```\n\n4. Save the changes and exit the editor.\n5. Restart the Mattermost service to apply the new configuration:\n\n```\nsudo systemctl restart mattermost\n```\n\nBy modifying the `mattermost.env` file, you'll be able to change the site URL for your Mattermost server. After restarting the service, the new URL should take effect.\n\nRegarding the missing `config.json` file, the Mattermost omnibus package uses environment variables for configuration instead of a JSON file. The `mattermost.env` file is the place to modify these variables.\n\nI hope this helps!

                "message_content": "Hi everyone,\n\nJust wanted to share an update on the project to develop React Native mobile apps. We'd love to find people who are experienced in Redux and React Native who might be interested in helping.\n\nIf you're interested, please join our [Mattermost Native Apps channel](https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/native-mobile-apps) to discuss.\n\n[We've written previously about why we chose React Native for our next generation of Mattermost mobile apps](http://forum.mattermost.com/t/fyi-project-underway-to-increase-mobile-app-performance-on-slow-internet-connections-using-react-native/2219).\n\nHere's what we're trying to get completed:\n\n####  1) Getting out a framework with Redux and React Native by October 31 that works with the Mattermost server APIs.\n\nAfter Oct 31 the Mattermost server APIs are locked as we prepare to release to our open source community.\n\nWe're working in a private repro to start, since in the early days it's harder to work in larger groups.\n\nFRAMEWORK BACKLOG:\n\n  * Redux (first several examples, but not all the APIs)\n  * Redux test framework\n  * Offline storage (first several examples, but not all the APIs)\n  * Developer build and tools\n  * Code style guidelines and checker\n  * Basic navigation framework\n  * Common controls, error boxes, buttons, etc.\n  * iOS specific additions\n  * Android specific additions\n  * Framework for theming styles\n  * i18n support\n  * Automated builds\n  * Bare bones documentation\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n  * User Experience \n    * To see the full mobile web UI and try the existing mobile apps, sign-up for a Mattermost account at <https://pre-release.mattermost.com/>\n    * Go to Main Menu > Download Apps to download iOS and Android apps and login with the server URL and your new credentials\n  * Developer info \n    * [Mattermost iOS app](https://github.com/mattermost/ios) (notifications, native login & web view) -\n    * [Mattermost Android app](https://github.com/mattermost/android) (notifications, native login & web view)\n    * [Mattermost JavaScript driver](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-driver-javascript)\n    * [Mattermost API documentation](https://api.mattermost.com/)\n    * [Mattermost Style Guide](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/style-guide.html)\n\n\n\nAfter the framework is open sourced, we hope to work with the community to build the next phase.\n\n####  2) From Oct 31 to November 28, getting a minimal viable iOS and Android client in React Native and Redux.\n\nBACKLOG for Minimal Viable Product (P2 and P3 indicate lower priority tier):\n\n  * **Log in and \"Hello world\" hard-coded channel view:** Login to server with basic email authentication and automatically log into first team, show Town Square channel with usernames, time stamp, usernames (looks like compact view with no profile pics), and plain text message contents.\n\n  * **Switch channels:** Add icon in top left of channel view to open lefthand sidebar to view list of public channels, private groups and direct messages. Scroll up and down channels. Switch channels by tapping on new channels.\n\n  * **Channel notifications:** Unread flag and mention count show on app icon, channel names and icon in top left of mobile view. (P2) \"Unread post(s) above/below\" indicators at the top and bottom of left-hand sidebar when channels with unreads are not in view.\n\n  * **(P2) Push Notifications:** Display push notifications on locked screen and when app is in the background, (P3) and remove push notifications after user reads the message on another device. Deep link from push notification to message.\n\n  * **Basic Right Menu with logout:** Add options menu button in top right of channel view, opening to right sidebar menu with logout option.\n\n  * **(P3) Status indicators:** Enable display of user status in DM headers in center channel and lefthand sidebar and on profile pics in channels\n\n\n\n\nAfter the initial release, we'd like to knock out some of the following as well:\n\nAPPENDIX: BACKLOG FOLLOWING Minimal Viable Product\n\n  * **Replies and RHS:** In channel, show replies as replies instead of messages. Open reply threads in RHS. Optionally render profile pics if user has chosen full view.\n\n  * **Message actions:** Enable message delete, permalink and flag/unflag.\n\n  * **Markdown & emojis:** Enable markdown support, emoji and custom emoji rendering in messages and channel headers header.\n\n  * **Options:** Add options menu button from top right of channel view. Add menus and UI for Account Settings, Invites, Team Setting, Manage Members,\n\n  * **Images and files:** In channel, show links to non-image files. Add ability to attach a file from mobile. Show previews of image files and PDFs. Show public share link if enabled on server.\n\n  * **Search:** Enable search in RHS with flag and mention short cuts.\n\n  * **Channel headers:** Enable information icon in channel header to display channel header info.",

Here's what you can do:\n\n  1. Open your Mattermost web app (Chrome) and go to your Account Settings by clicking on your profile picture in the top-left corner and selecting \"Account Settings.\"\n  2. In the Account Settings menu, click on \"Notifications\" in the left sidebar.\n  3. Scroll down to the \"Direct Messages\" section and make sure that the \"Desktop\" option is selected for direct message notifications. This will ensure that you receive incoming call notifications when someone initiates a call from a private channel.\n  4. Additionally, you should also check the settings under the \"Channels\" section to make sure the \"Desktop\" option is enabled for channel notifications. This will ensure that you receive notifications when someone initiates a call from a public channel.\n\n\n\nPlease note that if you have multiple devices logged in with different accounts, you'll need to configure the notification settings for each account separately.\n\nIf you're still not receiving notifications after following these steps, there are a few more things you can check:\n\n  * Ensure that your Mattermost desktop app is running and logged in with the correct account.\n  * Verify that your desktop app's notification settings are also correctly configured.\n  * Make sure that your browser notifications are enabled for the Mattermost web app. You can check this by clicking on the lock icon in the address bar and verifying that notifications are allowed.\n\n\n\nIf the issue persists, please let me know, and I'll be happy to assist you further!\n\nBest regards,  \n~Matterbot 2.0 ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This is a new AI response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

No known steps to reproduce reliably.  \nI do not know whether there are any consistent user settings that are always present when this occurs because I have had only had a lot of indirect reports of it. When observing the issue myself, it has been when using channel groups, where the messages should be in the collapsed \"Direct Messages\" group but no channel is shown there.\n\n**Expected behavior**  \nWhen someone messages me in a direct/group channel, the channel should appear in the sidebar and be marked as unread.\n\n**Observed behavior**  \nOccasionally this fails to happen for a specific direct/group channel. Even when there are more messages later in the same channel, it still doesn't appear as unread in the sidebar. That situation can persist for hours. In this case the unread messages indicator (e.g. the dot on the app icon) _does_ indicate an unread message, even if the UI shows no channels at all as being unread in the sidebar. This may lead the user to realise that something is not being shown because the UI shows all channels as read, yet the unread indicator on the icon says that something is unread; the user then refreshes the client, and finds an entire conversation waiting to be read.\n\nRefreshing the client resolves the issue and the channel is then shown as unread.",

The error message suggests that there might be a problem with the Amazon S3 connection authorization parameters and authentication settings.\n\nBased on the information you provided, it seems that you have copied the `config.json` file from the Ubuntu installed version to the Docker installation. However, you mentioned that you had to switch from using an IAM role attached to an EC2 to using an AWS Key and Secret Key for authentication. This change may have caused the issue.\n\nTo resolve the problem, you need to update the `config.json` file in your Docker installation with the correct AWS access key ID and secret access key. Make sure to replace the empty strings `\"\"` in the `AmazonS3AccessKeyId` and `AmazonS3SecretAccessKey` fields with the appropriate values.\n\nHere's an example of how the relevant part of your `config.json` file should look:\n\n[config.json example omitted for brevity]\n\nMake sure to replace `\"YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\"` and `\"YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\"` with your actual AWS access key ID and secret access key, respectively.\n\nOnce you've made these changes, restart your Mattermost Docker container, and it should be able to connect to the S3 bucket and display profile pictures and uploaded images.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance!\n\nBest regards,\n~Matterbot 2.0 ![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/robot.png?v=12)\n\n_[**Disclaimer:** This is a new AI response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

As you can see here, your mattermost application container is only listening on the port 8065 on the external interface which is also the port your nginx is proxying too.

It seems that the error you encountered is related to missing attachments in the data folder.\n\nCurrently, there isn't a specific flag or option in `mmctl` to exclude only broken attachments during the bulk export process. The `--exclude-attachments` flag is designed to exclude all attachments, which may not be what you're looking for.\n\nHowever, there might be a workaround you can try. You can manually copy the attachments from your backup files to the appropriate location in the new Mattermost installation. This way, you can ensure that existing attachments are preserved even if some are missing.\n\nHere are the general steps to follow:\n\n  1. Verify that you have a backup of the attachments from the broken server.\n  2. Identify the missing attachments mentioned in the error message.\n  3. Copy the missing attachments from your backup to the corresponding location in the new Mattermost data folder. In this case, it seems to be `data/20220201/teams/noteam/channels/1cs686q9of8yjjrd4zy6yafs1c/users/tdio5gsxmpnu3mn9arz7i1qoic/yntjb8dcujnu5m48up5m7iu1wr/`.\n  4. After copying the attachments, you can retry the bulk export using `mmctl export create` to see if the process completes successfully.\n\n\n\nRemember to make backups of the current data folder in case anything goes wrong during the copying process.\n\nI hope this workaround helps you preserve the existing attachments during the bulk export process.

To further troubleshoot this problem, I would recommend checking the following:\n\n  1. Verify the Jira webhook configuration: Double-check that the webhook URL is correct and properly configured in Jira. Ensure that the webhook is enabled and set to trigger events for the desired issue actions.\n  2. Check Mattermost incoming webhook settings: Ensure that the Mattermost incoming webhook is properly configured with the correct URL and channel settings. Make sure that the webhook is enabled and active.\n  3. Review Mattermost server logs and configuration: Check the Mattermost server logs for any related errors or warnings. Additionally, review the Mattermost configuration file to confirm that the `EnableIncomingWebhooks` setting is enabled.\n  4. Test webhook connectivity: Try testing the webhook connectivity using a tool like curl or Postman. Send a sample webhook payload to the Mattermost incoming webhook URL and verify if it is received and processed correctly.\n\n\n\nIf you've already performed these steps and are still encountering issues, please provide more details about your setup, including the versions of Mattermost and Jira you're using. Additionally, any relevant log entries or error messages would be helpful in diagnosing the problem.\n\nBest regards,\n~Matterbot 1.0\n\n_[Disclaimer: This is a new automated response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

The error message you provided suggests that there might be an issue with the configuration or connection settings. Here are a few steps you can try to troubleshoot the problem:\n\n1. Verify the connection settings: Double-check the database connection settings in your Mattermost configuration file (`config.json`). Ensure that the hostname, port, username, password, and database name are correct.\n2. Ensure MariaDB is running: Check if MariaDB is running and accessible from the container where Mattermost is deployed. You can try connecting to MariaDB from the command line using the same connection details to confirm its availability.\n3. Check network accessibility: Make sure that the container running Mattermost can access the MariaDB server. If they are running on separate machines, ensure that the necessary network configurations (firewalls, security groups, etc.) allow communication between them.\n4. Test the connection manually: You can try connecting to MariaDB from within the container running Mattermost using tools like `mysql` or `telnet` to verify if the connection works. This will help identify if the issue is specific to Mattermost or a more general connection problem.\n5. Review the container configuration: Double-check that you have properly set up the container and its environment variables. Ensure that the necessary environment variables for connecting to MariaDB are correctly provided.\n\nIf you've already followed these steps and are still encountering issues, please provide more details about your setup, such as the versions of Mattermost, MariaDB, and the containerization platform you're using. Additionally, any relevant configuration files or logs would be helpful for further troubleshooting.\n\nBest regards,\n~Matterbot 2.0 \ud83e\udd16\n\n[Disclaimer: This is a new AI response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

This command is intended to reconfigure Mattermost settings, not modify your Nginx configuration.\n\nIt's possible that the Omnibus package you are using has a default configuration that overwrites your custom `nginx.conf` file during the reconfiguration process. To prevent this from happening, you can modify the Omnibus configuration file for Mattermost.\n\nTo do this, open the Omnibus configuration file located at `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` using a text editor. Look for the section related to Mattermost and find the `mattermost_nginx['custom_nginx_config']` option. Uncomment this option if necessary and add the relevant configuration directives to increase the upload limit to 100M. Save the changes.\n\nAfter modifying the configuration file, run the following command to apply the changes:\n\n```\nsudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure\n```\n\nThis will reconfigure your Mattermost installation without modifying your Nginx configuration.\n\nPlease note that the specific configuration and file paths may vary depending on your system setup and installation method. Make sure to adjust the instructions accordingly.\n\nBest regards,  \n~Matterbot 1.0\n\n_[Disclaimer: This is a new automated response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

Open a terminal or command prompt.\n  2. Run the following command to edit the `mmctl` configuration:\n\n\n    \n    \n    mmctl config edit\n    \n\nThis will open the configuration file in your default editor.  \n3\\. Look for the `ServerURL` parameter in the configuration file and update it with the new TLS connection and port. For example:\n    \n    \n    \"ServerURL\": \"https://domain_name.de/\"\n    \n\n  4. Save the changes and exit the editor.\n\n\n\nAfter updating the configuration, try running the `mmctl channel move` command again.

Logging the `Authorization` header on all incoming requests to the proxy did reveal cases of a user setting `Authorization: Bearer None` on their incoming webhook posts, leading to this error.\n\nI think we could make this easier to track down by including the following in the logging:\n\n* the full request path\n* where the token was found (header or cookie)\n\nIn theory the full request path _is_ logged, but it's a debug log line and is from a `defer` call.

The Audits table stores valuable information about user actions, system events, and other important data for auditing and compliance purposes.\n\nBefore deleting any data, consider the following:\n\n  1. **Retention Policy** : Determine your organization's data retention policy and make sure you're not violating any requirements.\n  2. **Backup** : Ensure you have a recent backup of your Mattermost instance in case you need to restore the deleted data.\n  3. **Database Size** : Identify if the Audits table is unusually large compared to other tables and investigate if there are any underlying issues causing excessive growth.\n\n\n\nIf you decide to proceed with deleting data from the Audits table, you can use the following steps:\n\n  1. **Database Backup** : Take a backup of your Mattermost database to ensure you can recover in case of any issues.\n  2. **Data Pruning** : Use database management tools such as SQL queries or database administration tools to delete the desired records from the Audits table. You can choose to delete older records or specific types of data based on your requirements.\n\n\n\nPlease note that the exact steps and queries may vary depending on your database setup. If you're unsure about the process, it's recommended to consult with your database administrator or reach out to the Mattermost support team for assistance.\n\nRemember to carefully consider the impact of deleting data from the Audits table and ensure it aligns with your organization's policies and requirements.\n\nI hope this helps!

Received the email stating \"It appears your Mattermost email is setup correctly!\"\nBut when I try to reset the password for a user, no relevant logs can be seen and i did not receive the email.\n\n**Observed behavior**\nno email is recived, not even in the spam section.",

However, you are unable to access the server from your local machine. Here are a few tips to troubleshoot the issue:\n\n1. **Check Firewall Settings**: Ensure that the firewall on your private server allows incoming connections on the specified port number. You mentioned that the iptables rules are in place, but double-check that the rules are correctly configured to allow incoming traffic.\n2. **Check Network Configuration**: Verify that your private server has a public IP address or is accessible through a public network. If your server is behind a router or firewall, you may need to set up port forwarding to ensure incoming connections reach the correct server.\n3. **Verify Correct Port**: Make sure you are using the correct port number when accessing the Mattermost server. Double-check the configuration file (`/opt/mattermost/config/config.json`) to confirm the port number the server is configured to listen on.\n4. **Check Network Connectivity**: Ensure that your local machine can reach the private server over the network. You can try using tools like `telnet` or `curl` from your local machine to test connectivity to the server's IP address and port number.\nFor example, from your local machine, run the following command in the terminal:\n\n```\ntelnet server_ip Port-Number\n```\n\nIf the connection is successful, it means your local machine can reach the server. If not, you may need to troubleshoot the network connectivity between your local machine and the private server.\n5. **Review Mattermost Logs**: Check the Mattermost server logs (`/opt/mattermost/logs`) for any errors or warnings that might provide insights into the issue. Look for any log entries related to incoming connections or networking.\n\nIf you are still experiencing issues after following these tips, it may be helpful to provide more details about your server setup, network environment, and any error messages or logs you observe.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any further concerns or need additional assistance, please don't hesitate to let me know.\n\nBest regards,\n~Matterbot 1.0\n\n_[Disclaimer: This is a new automated response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

The error message suggests that the channel couldn't be found, resulting in a 404 error.\n\nIn Mattermost Cloud, channel IDs are not exposed directly in the UI, so it's expected that using the channel ID directly in the webhook payload won't work. Instead, you can use the channel's name or handle to send messages to specific channels.\n\nTo send a message to a channel using an incoming webhook in Mattermost Cloud, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Open the Mattermost user interface and navigate to the channel you want to send a message to.\n  2. Click on the channel's name in the header to open the channel menu.\n  3. From the channel menu, select \"Integrations\" and then \"Incoming Webhooks\".\n  4. Click on \"Add Incoming Webhook\" to create a new webhook.\n  5. Configure the webhook settings, including the channel to post messages to, and save the webhook.\n  6. The webhook URL will be provided once the webhook is created. Copy this URL.\n  7. Use the copied webhook URL in your curl command to send a message to the channel. Replace the `{webhook_url}` placeholder with the actual webhook URL, and use the channel name or handle instead of the channel ID in the payload. Here's an example:\n\n\n    \n    \n    curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"text\": \"yay!\", \"channel\": \"channel_name\"}' {webhook_url}\n    \n\nMake sure to replace `channel_name` with the actual name or handle of the channel you want to send the message to, and `{webhook_url}` with the copied webhook URL.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to send a message to a specific channel in Mattermost Cloud using an incoming webhook.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please don't hesitate to ask!\n\nBest regards,  \n~Matterbot 1.0\n\n_[Disclaimer: This is a new automated response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n1. Access the Mattermost server where you have administrative privileges.\n2. Locate the HTML template file for the user registration page. The file path may vary depending on your installation method and configuration. By default, the file is located at `mattermost/webapp/templates/signup_email.html`.\n3. Create a backup of the original `signup_email.html` file to ensure you can revert any changes if needed.\n4. Open the `signup_email.html` file in a text editor.\n5. Look for the `<form>` tag within the HTML code. This is where the registration form is defined.\n6. Add a new input field for the phone number. You can use the `<input>` HTML tag with the `type` attribute set to `tel` to indicate a phone number input field. Here's an example of a phone number input field:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"tel\" name=\"phone\" id=\"phone\" placeholder=\"Phone Number\" required>\n```\n\nCustomize the input field attributes, such as the `name`, `id`, and `placeholder`, according to your preference.\n7. Save the changes to the `signup_email.html` file.\n8. Restart the Mattermost server for the changes to take effect.\n\nAfter completing these steps, the user registration page will include a new input field for the phone number. When users register, they'll be able to enter their phone number as part of the registration process.\n\nPlease note that modifying the HTML code directly is considered a customization and may require additional maintenance when updating Mattermost to a new version. It's recommended to test the changes in a development or staging environment before applying them to a production server.\n\nHope this helps,\n~Matterbot 1.0\n\n_[Disclaimer: This is a new automated response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

To troubleshoot this problem, please follow these steps:\n\n  1. Verify that push notifications are properly configured in your Mattermost server. Ensure that the necessary settings for push notifications are correctly set up in your server's configuration file (`config.json` or `config.yaml`). Specifically, check the `PushNotification` section and make sure it contains the correct values for `EnablePushNotifications`, `PushNotificationServer`, and `PushNotificationContents` according to your notification service provider.\n  2. Confirm that your Mattermost server has network connectivity and can access the necessary services for push notifications. The error message you provided includes a timeout error while trying to get the public IP address. Ensure that your server can connect to the internet and reach the required services.\n  3. Check the logs of your Mattermost server to identify any specific errors related to push notifications. The logs you shared indicate an error with the plugin `com.mattermost.calls`, which might be unrelated to push notifications. However, it's worth examining the logs more thoroughly to see if there are any other relevant error messages.\n  4. Verify that the Mattermost mobile application has the necessary permissions to receive push notifications on the devices. Check the notification settings for the Mattermost app on both Android and iOS devices and ensure that it has the appropriate permissions enabled.\n  5. Make sure you have the latest version of the Mattermost mobile application installed. Check for any available updates in the Google Play Store (for Android) or the App Store (for iOS) and install the latest version if necessary. Sometimes, updating the app can resolve issues related to push notifications.\n\n\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please provide any additional error messages or logs related to push notifications that might help in diagnosing the problem.\n\nHope this helps,  \n~Matterbot 1.0\n\n_[Disclaimer: This is a new automated response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

Downgrade the mmctl client to a version that matches your Mattermost server version (5.3.0). You can find the older versions of mmctl on the Mattermost GitHub repository (Releases \u00b7 mattermost/mmctl \u00b7 GitHub). Download the mmctl binary for version 5.3.0 and replace the existing mmctl binary with the downgraded version.\n\nNote: Downgrading the mmctl client may limit access to certain features available in the newer versions. Make sure to check the release notes of the mmctl versions to understand any limitations or changes between versions.\n\nOnce you have resolved the version mismatch between the Mattermost server and mmctl client, try running the data import process again using the updated versions.

Let's try to troubleshoot the problem and find a solution.\n\nRegarding the failed upgrade to version 7.10, the error message suggests that the Mattermost user (mmapp) doesn't have access to the Mattermost database. However, you mentioned that you were able to sign into MySQL and change values manually, so it seems that the user does have access. To further investigate this, please check the following:\n\n  1. Ensure that the Mattermost user (mmapp) has the necessary privileges on the Mattermost database. You can verify this by running the following command in MySQL: `SHOW GRANTS FOR 'mmapp'@'%';`\n  2. Double-check the database configuration in your Mattermost configuration file (`config.json` or `config.yaml`). Make sure that the username, password, and database name are correctly specified.\n\n\n\nRegarding the attempt to upgrade to version 5.35.5, the error message indicates an issue with the configuration file. To resolve this, please follow these steps:\n\n  1. Make sure you have a backup of your existing Mattermost installation before proceeding.\n  2. Check your existing `config.json` or `config.yaml` file for any customizations or plugins that might be causing the issue. You can try temporarily removing those customizations and plugins to see if the upgrade process can proceed.\n  3. If the issue persists, consider generating a new default configuration file using the `platform` command. Run the following command from your Mattermost installation directory:\n\n\n    \n    \n    sudo -u mattermost ./bin/mattermost platform config > new_config.json\n    \n\nThis command will generate a new configuration file (`new_config.json`) with default settings. You can then compare this file with your existing configuration file to identify any discrepancies or missing settings.  \n4\\. Once you have a new configuration file, try the upgrade process again using the `new_config.json` file. Make sure to update the necessary paths and settings in the new file before proceeding.\n\nIf you encounter any errors or issues during the upgrade process, please share the specific error messages or logs so that I can assist you further.\n\nRemember to always have a backup of your Mattermost instance before attempting any upgrades or modifications to ensure you can easily revert back if needed.\n\nHope this helps,  \n~Matterbot 1.0\n\n_[Disclaimer: This is a new automated response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

I understand that your data is crucial, and I'm here to assist you in the migration process.\n\nMattermost supports upgrades between major versions, so upgrading from version 5.0 to 7.10.2 is indeed possible. However, it is important to follow the recommended upgrade path to ensure a smooth transition and avoid any potential issues.\n\nBefore proceeding with the upgrade, I recommend taking the following steps:\n\n  1. **Backup your data** : Make a backup of your Mattermost instance, including the database and any relevant configuration files. This ensures that you have a reliable restore point in case anything goes wrong during the upgrade process.\n  2. **Review the release notes** : Familiarize yourself with the release notes for each intermediate version between 5.0 and 7.10.2. Pay close attention to any specific upgrade instructions, database schema changes, or migration steps that may be required.\n  3. **Test the upgrade** : Set up a testing environment where you can replicate your production instance. Perform the upgrade process on the test environment first to identify any potential issues and ensure a successful migration.\n\n\n\nOnce you have completed these preliminary steps, you can proceed with the upgrade process itself. Here is a high-level overview of the recommended upgrade path:\n\n  1. Upgrade your existing Mattermost 5.0 installation to the latest available version in the 5.x series by following the upgrade instructions provided in the release notes for each intermediate version.\n  2. Once you have successfully upgraded to the latest version in the 5.x series, you can proceed with the upgrade to Mattermost 6.0. Again, follow the release notes and upgrade instructions for each intermediate version until you reach 7.10.2.\n  3. After upgrading to Mattermost 7.10.2, verify that your data and functionality are intact by thoroughly testing the system in your testing environment. This step is crucial to ensure that all data from your old version has been successfully migrated.\n  4. If everything works as expected in the testing environment, you can then plan the upgrade in your production environment. Make sure to communicate the maintenance window and any potential downtime to your users in advance.\n\n\n\nPlease note that the specific steps and considerations may vary depending on your specific deployment and configuration. It's essential to consult the official Mattermost documentation for the version you're upgrading to and to reach out to our support team or community forums if you encounter any difficulties or have further questions.\n\nI hope this guidance helps you in successfully migrating from Mattermost version 5.0 to version 7.10.2. If you have any further concerns or need additional assistance, please don't hesitate to let me know.\n\nBest regards,\n~Matterbot 1.0\n\n_[Disclaimer: This is a new automated response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

My assumption was that the Mattermost Extension wasn't the latest version of Mattermost. Mattermost is at 7.8.0 I believe.

I understand that you are facing issues with the Mattermost extension on Plesk and are considering using Docker for installation. I'll be glad to assist you with your queries.\n\nRegarding the Mattermost extension on Plesk, it seems that you are using version 7.1.0, which might not be the latest release. Mattermost is currently at version 7.8.0, as you mentioned. However, please note that the Plesk extension might not always be immediately updated to the latest Mattermost version. The Plesk extension team typically works on ensuring stability and compatibility before releasing updates.\n\nNow, let's address your questions regarding installing Mattermost with Docker. Deploying Mattermost with Docker containers provides a flexible and convenient way to set up a self-hosted Mattermost server. While the official Mattermost Docker installation page primarily provides command line instructions, I can guide you through the process using Docker images.\n\nTo install a self-hosted Mattermost setup with Docker, you would typically need to run multiple containers to set up the necessary components. The main container required is the Mattermost Team Edition (or Enterprise Edition if you have a license), which contains the Mattermost server itself. Additionally, you will need a database container to store the server data.\n\nTo get started, you can refer to the official Mattermost Docker installation guide ([Redirect](https://docs.mattermost.com/install/docker-local-machine.html)) for detailed instructions. This guide will provide you with a step-by-step walkthrough, including the Docker commands required to set up the Mattermost server and the database.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing the Mattermost Docker images, you can use the official Mattermost Docker images available on Docker Hub ([Docker](https://hub.docker.com/u/mattermost)). These images are maintained by the Mattermost team and provide a reliable and secure way to run Mattermost in Docker containers. You can choose the appropriate image based on the edition (Team or Enterprise) and version you wish to use.\n\nIf you prefer a more graphical interface for managing Docker, you might consider using tools like Portainer or Docker Compose. These tools provide a web-based interface that simplifies Docker container management and configuration. They can be particularly helpful if you are not comfortable with command line instructions.\n\nI hope this information helps you in setting up your self-hosted Mattermost installation using Docker. If you have any further questions or encounter any issues during the process, please don't hesitate to ask for assistance. We are here to help you.\n\nBest regards,  \n~Matterbot 1.0\n\n_[Disclaimer: This is a new automated response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

I'm glad you found the answer interesting, and I'm here to help you with your question regarding Docker installation.\n\nTo use Docker, you have a couple of options. You can either install Docker directly on your server running CentOS Linux 7.9.2009 or install it on your MacOS laptop and use it to communicate with your server. Both approaches are valid, and the choice depends on your specific requirements and preferences.\n\nIf you choose to install Docker directly on your CentOS Linux server, you can follow the instructions provided in the Docker documentation specifically for CentOS. You can find the installation guide for CentOS at the following link: [Docker installation guide for CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/)\n\nOn the other hand, if you prefer to install Docker on your MacOS laptop and communicate with your server, you can set up Docker on your laptop and use it to manage and deploy containers on your CentOS server remotely. In this case, you would need to ensure that you have network connectivity and appropriate permissions to access and manage your server.\n\nThe Docker installation choices you mentioned (MacOS, Windows, Ubuntu, and Fedora) refer to the operating systems on which you can install Docker. While Docker itself is platform-agnostic and supports multiple operating systems, the installation steps may vary slightly depending on the platform.\n\nIn summary, you can either install Docker directly on your CentOS Linux server or install it on your MacOS laptop and use it to communicate with and manage containers on your server. Choose the approach that aligns with your needs and technical setup.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please don't hesitate to ask!\n\nBest regards,  \n~Matterbot 1.0\n\n_[Disclaimer: This is a new automated response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

It seems like you've encountered a problem with the GitLab login functionality on the mobile app after being redirected back to the app. Let's troubleshoot the situation and find a solution together.\n\nThe behavior you described indicates that there might be an issue with the deep linking configuration on the mobile app. Deep linking allows the app to handle specific URLs or redirects to bring users to specific screens or actions within the app. To ensure a smooth experience for users, it's crucial to configure the deep linking settings correctly.\n\nRegarding your question about configuring a custom app name, location, and ID, Mattermost does provide options to customize these settings. However, the issue you're facing is likely not related to those specific configurations. Instead, we should focus on the deep linking setup.\n\nTo resolve this problem, please follow these steps:\n\n  1. Verify that you have set up the deep linking settings correctly in your Mattermost mobile app. This typically involves configuring the associated URL schemes or Universal Links for iOS and Android Intents for Android.\n  2. Double-check that the redirect URL specified in your GitLab configuration matches the deep linking configuration you set in the Mattermost app. Make sure it includes the correct URL scheme or Universal Link for iOS, and Intent for Android.\n  3. Test the deep linking functionality by opening a web browser on the mobile device and attempting to access the redirect URL directly. This will help identify any potential issues with the deep linking configuration.\n  4. If the direct access to the redirect URL works correctly, try clearing the cache and data of the Mattermost mobile app on your device. Then, attempt the GitLab login again to see if the issue persists.\n  5. If the issue still persists, please provide more specific details about your Mattermost server version, the steps you followed during the installation, and any relevant error messages or logs you encountered. This information will be helpful for further investigation.\n\nI hope these steps help you resolve the issue with GitLab login on the mobile app. If you have any further questions or encounter any difficulties, please don't hesitate to reach out. Our team is here to provide you with the necessary assistance.\n\nBest regards,  \n~Matterbot 1.0\n\n_[Disclaimer: This is a new automated response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

You need to verify that you can connect from a client to your server on UDP port 8443. You can do that using the `nc` command line utility f.ex.\nTo do that, stop the calls plugin, the local port `8443` on your Hetzner VPS should be unoccupied again.\nOn the VPS, run the following command:\n\n```\nnc -l -u -p 8443 \n```\n\nOn a client, run:\n\n```\nnc -u <public_IP> 8443\n```\n\nYou can then start typing in any of the two commands and the text should appear on both ends when you hit return.

I'd be glad to assist you with creating a quick command to send specific text to a channel in Mattermost. While Mattermost doesn't have built-in support for creating custom shortcuts, we can achieve your desired functionality using slash commands and message composition.\n\nTo create a server maintenance template with two variables (time and type of work), follow these steps:\n\n  1. Open the channel where you want to send the maintenance notification.\n  2. Click on the text input box to focus on it.\n  3. Type \"/command\" (replace \"command\" with the desired command name, e.g., \"/maintenance\").\n  4. Press Enter to send the slash command message.\n  5. Now, you'll need to configure your Mattermost server to handle this slash command. As a technical support manager, you may need to collaborate with your system administrator or IT team to ensure the following steps are executed correctly:  \na. Open the Mattermost server administration panel.  \nb. Navigate to \"Integrations\" or a similar section where you can manage slash commands.  \nc. Create a new slash command with the desired name (e.g., \"maintenance\") and specify the URL that will handle the command.  \nd. Configure the URL to receive the command, extract the provided variables (time and type of work), and compose a message accordingly.  \ne. Make sure the URL responds with a properly formatted JSON response containing the composed message.\n  6. Once the server is configured, return to Mattermost and use the slash command you created in step 3. - For example: /maintenance 10:00 PM, Server Maintenance. This command should trigger the configured URL, which will extract the time and type of work variables from the command and compose a message.\n  7. The composed message will be posted to the channel you initiated the slash command in.\n\n\n\nBy following these steps, you can achieve the desired functionality of sending specific text to a channel with a quick command in Mattermost. If you encounter any issues during the configuration process or have further questions, please let me know, and I'll be happy to assist you.\n\nBest regards,  \n~Matterbot 1.0\n\n_[Disclaimer: This is a new automated response feature we're testing powered by ChatGPT.

The main effects for users is channels and messages are loading slowly and search is basically non functional, it times out and is unable to get results on known good search terms. Here's an example of some of the logs we're seeing:\n\n> {\"timestamp\":\"2022-09-07 05:26:05.956 Z\",\"level\":\"error\",\"msg\":\"Unable to get post counts.\",\"caller\":\"web/context.go:105\",\"path\":\"/api/v4/analytics/old\",\"request_id\":\"yesryqp6jf87jpmj4kte7bnhbw\",\"ip_addr\":\"127.0.0.1\",\"user_id\":\"prxcr796d78g7mem1h4f9scx7e\",\"method\":\"GET\",\"err_where\":\"GetAnalytics\",\"http_code\":500,\"err_details\":\"failed to count Posts: pq: canceling statement due to user request\"}\n\nAfter the problems started we bumped it from a t3.large to an xlarge, but the problems didn't get any better. We decided to give that a shot based on another post here that had similar issues where it boiled down to database performance (here: [Unable to get the file count for the channel](https://forum.mattermost.com/t/unable-to-get-the-file-count-for-the-channel/13859)). Our instance is bigger than theirs was (we're around 24,000,000 posts), so it's possible it would benefit from another power bump, but the cpu utilization for our RDS instance seems to point to a massive performance drop with the 7.1 upgrade.\n\nYou can pretty clearly see the point where the upgrade to 7.1 occurred on August 31. We went from a fairly consistent utilization to spiking to 100% during business hours. You can also see when we upgraded the instance to the xlarge, and the new cpu 'baseline' usage dropped to around 10% during evenings and weekends, but the heavy spikes remained. There is another service that uses this RDS instance, but it did not receive any upgrades at the same time as Mattermost.\n\nAny ideas or guidance here would be extremely appreciated.",

Still seeing the same errors in the logs though.\n\nAlso since my last post I've realized the spikes in CPU utilization seem to happen anytime any one user starts a search. I ran a search late when very few people were signed in, and saw the instance spike to nearly 80% cpu usage from my single search. In addition looking through the database logs has tons of the same kinds of errors as the Mattermost logs:\n\n> gitlab_mattermost@mattermost_production:[29772]:ERROR: canceling statement due to user request\n\nAlso on @mayqueeen idea with IOPS, there is a spike in the read IOPS that looks like it corresponds to spikes in cpu usage on running a search. What did you bump your SSD capacity from/to?\n\nWe didn't bump the storage size yet based on AWS docs that said baseline IO performance won't improve above the 'burst' performance until you hit 1TiB, and we're only at 200GiB. It's possible those docs are out of date though, as our IOPS seem to regularly go far above what they claim is the max for burst performance.\n\nAgain thanks for the fast help and responses\n\nEdit: Looks like the searches do still fail in the same way on the backend.

One notable thing is a tried changing the query timeout in Mattermost to 60 seconds and it didn't really help, but this being right at that 60 seems interesting given that.\n\nAlso we've found one way to make some searches work: restricting it to a specific channel. If you make a search using the 'in:' flag, the search is near instant and doesn't cause any performance hit. As soon as the search has to go across multiple channels it becomes extremely slow and the timeouts start.\n\nIn terms of version number, I tried tracking down the exact version number because we are running it through a gitlab instance, and I wasn't having the best luck in tracking down what Gitlab version has what Mattermost version. But based on the UI changes that also happened during the upgrade, I believe it was a 6.x version.",

You seem to want to run mattermost in a subpath (which is not really a good idea, it causes several problems AFAIR), so f.ex. `https://yourdomain.tld/mattermost` and if you want to do that, you will also need to set this exact URL as the `SiteUrl` in Mattermost, otherwise the generated links will not be correct and might point to `https://yourdomain.tld/something/something` instead of `https://yourdomain.tld/mattermost/something/something` which could cause the errors you're seeing then (nginx not proxying the request and trying to serve it from the local filesystem).",

Set up NGINX as a reverse proxy for the Mattermost server, terminating SSL 2. Assure that NGINX is set up only for TLS1.3 using recommendations from Mozilla (https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/#server=nginx&version=1.17.7&config=modern&openssl=1.1.1d&guideline=5.4) 3.

I am also running Mattermost 3.2.0. Debian and all packages are fully upgraded and running the latest versions. I am only running packages from the official debian repositories.\n\nTo reproduce my setup, install the latest debian, selecting only ssh server - no other services or desktops. Download and install the free 10 doamin version of Virtualmin which will install and configure apache, email, etc. Install PostgreSQL from inside Virtualmin. Virtual hosting will also be setup. Create a domain and enable PostgreSQL as the database for that domain, then create a subdomain. Install Mattermost into the subdomain (or parent domain if you prefer) following the Mattermost installation guide for Debian Jessie but not installing Postgres as it is already installed. Integrate the vhost info into the `domain.conf` or `sub.domain.conf` depending on where you want to access Mattermost. After following the instructions including tests, you should have a functioning install.\n\nNow try having Mattermost run from `/home/domain/mattermost` or `/home/domain/domains/sub-domain/mattermost` or even just put the data directory in those locations with permissions for the mattermost directory structure owned by `mattermost:mattermost`.\n\nAlternatively, leaving mattermost fully installed and running from `/opt/mattermost`, create domain2 and then set it up so that it also accesses the same server - without exposing the first domains teams.\n\n#### Expected behavior\n\nI would like to be able to have mattermost run completely from inside a vhost so that I can cleanly migrate or backup all domain assets as the occasion arises.\n\n#### Observed behavior\n\nEverything is working from `/opt/mattermost`, but if I move it to /home/domain/mattermost then it does not run, or try to put the data directory in `/home/domain/mattermost/data` then none of that profile images work, etc.\n\nAlternatively, I want to be able to run mattermost from domain, domain1, etc. I haven't tried this config yet and it might actually work. I will hopefully be testing the second option in the next couple of days, but it would still be nice to have the data stored in the domain for migration purposes as well as backup and restore.",

The problem is, that the older docker deployment uses a PostgreSQL version that's not supported with the newer versions, so you need to make sure to upgrade the PostgreSQL version in the old deployment method first, but I have to admit, that I've never done that, since I'm not using any docker deployments myself and when I started to play with them, the \"new\" method was already available.\n\nThere are several ways to reach your goal, not sure which of them is the least cumbersome to be honest, you can also deploy a new installation somewhere else and migrate the files and the database over, which is probably as much hassle as going the other route.\n\nNot sure if you want to start this religious discussion here, talking about the pros and cons of containerized applications :slight_smile:\n\nWith regards to the future plans I was interested in the technical future of the deployment, sorry. So if you want to move this application to a new server maybe in the long run (not sure how old the host system is), if you want to consolidate applications internally and move these containers to a different host or if you want to dedicate a separate instance just for running Mattermost. Knowing that could lead to a different suggestion on about how to proceed.\nOmnibus f.ex. is being run without containers, but it's the easiest method when it comes to upgrades in the future, it's just `apt update && apt upgrade` and Mattermost will automatically be kept up2date, and it also comes bundled with backup scripts, etc. If you want to stick with the docker deployment, we'd have to start working on the conversion and the first step is to upgrade your postgres container with the scripts you found.\n\nYou can use the enterprise binary without a license, no problem with that. It's basically the same as the teams edition, it just gives you the option to install a license later on (and at some screens, it will tell you about the features of the enterprise edition, etc.).",

If an intermediate step is required (like when upgrading from 5.x to 7.x directly), it is mentioned in the important upgrade notes, but unless you read otherwise, you can always upgrade directly to the target version without intermediate steps.\n\nPlease read the important upgrade notes back to the version you're currently running on, there are several things to consider and some downtime probably needs to be planned for the database migration to happen.

The only thing I haven't tried yet is the \"try unlocking and locking your keychain in Xcode\" because that doesn't apply to CircleCI (unless I'm missing something really obvious).\nThe Fastfile being used is also the one from the official Mattermost Github.\nIt's weird because I was able to build it locally just fine with mattermost version 2.0 so I'm going to try that out next and post an update here in case it works.\n\nAlso thank you for forwarding the issue @agriesser!",

Deleting the Podfile.lock from my repository triggered a circleci build and it worked just fine and created a cache so now I'm not running into this issue anymore (not sure if it will happen again once it's not relying on the cache). I could also do \"pod update Rudder\" before pod install as a workaround, not really sure what the proper way of handling this would have been.

We have been self-hosting Mattermost since the Early 5.x release, with the addition of Mattermost Board we were thrilled as we can now have a more centralized way of managing our Kanbans, all integrated in Mattermost. However, due to a wild-ride of mismanagement we have decided to switch back to other platforms for Kanban and Board was shelved for awhile.\n\nAt some point during this duration, one of our technician updated Mattermost from 5.x to 7.x completely skipping important updates. As a result of incomplete or faulty SQL table migration, Boards no longer works. As off today, we have decided to revive Boards and to salvage some of the old data left on there.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\n\nDatabase: MySQL\n\nTimeline of our updates:\n\n2022-08-23: First update attempt: 6.4.2 \u2192 7.2 (skipping important updates)\n\n2022-11-16: Update attempt 6.4.2 \u2192 6.7 \u2192 7.0 ->7.2 Boards was still not working\n\n2022-12-06: No update was attempted however, MM logs showed this after some back tracking.\n\n[Error log details omitted for brevity]\n\n2023-05-01: We tried to take a peak at the database following this guide: [Error in Mattermost Boards after Upgrade to 7.5.1](https://forum.mattermost.com/t/error-in-mattermost-boards-after-upgrade-to-7-5-1/14614/7) (shout out to agriesser) and found out that 2 tables are missing focalboard_boards\", \"focalboard_boards_member\" and \"focalboard_boards_history\".\n\n[Table details omitted for brevity]\n\n**Expected behavior**\nMattermost Boards working again.\n\n**Observed behavior**\nMattermost Boards failed to start and only return errors.\n\nI can also provide more details if required.

These days it doesn't play well with Safari, so I decided to look at upgrading. I determined through the UI it's 4.3.0 or 4.3.1. As I started to read through the support docs, I found a few concerns:\n\n  * It is clear that upgrading from such an old version will require some intermediate steps. But how many I have to step through is unclear.\n  * For some reason the log says both \"Enterprise Enabled: true\" and \"License key required to unlock enterprise features\" - which I don't have and am not using. I'm assuming that Enterprise was the only edition back when I originally installed, and that it just went into team mode if you didn't give it a key.\n  * At least one version along the upgrade path mentioned significant database changes, such that a separate db backup might be required for restoration, along with configuration, to a new installation of mattermost\u2026\n\nSo: I want to upgrade to the latest free version for personal use. But the path is looking hard.\n\n(I have kept the Linux server itself up to date on a fairly regular basis, but because of my original manual installation of Mattermost, apt wasn't picking anything up for it, and by the time I realized this I decided to let it go because it was functional and I didn't need new features. Now it has a lot of history, and I'd rather not just blow it away and install the latest.)\n\nPreserving old messages and channel structure is the goal. Downtime is not a problem.\n\nBut my look through the docs seems to indicate that I'd need to pass through just about every version between the past and now. There are loads of \"before going to version x, you must first update to version y\u2026\"\n\nAnd the software has now split into more versions - I'm not sure whether it is even possible to \"cross-grade\" over to the Team version.\n\nAny guidance on key steps, land mines to avoid, etc. in upgrading from such an old version would be much appreciated. As I put a plan together I'll post it here for review, as well. Specific questions include:\n\n  1. Do I really need to pass through at least every major version along the way?\n  2. Which one (or, I fear) more upgrades are likely to be the most problematic?\n  3. Any docs outside of Mattermost's own I should be reading? Writeups of others' experiences, etc.?\n  4. Thoughts on the \"getting off of 'Enterprise'\"?\n\nAny guidance or pointers appreciated. While I do see a lot of docs on upgrading, they all seem to be version-to-version, which is a very long path at this point.",

If I were to take the database backup over to a fresh install of Ubuntu server and Mattermost 6.3.3 and restored it and fixed the schema and just had everyone create new users, would the older material be visible? Since this is literally just a family/friends thing, I don't have to maintain any integrations or even persist identity. We just want to have the old discussion history and pictures and stuff. It doesn't have to remain editable by post owners, etc.\n\n  2. I have the database backup already, but am unsure where files - like images posted in channels - are stored. The database seems too small to possibly contain them.\n\nMy current plan is to try your path. I took Ubuntu from 16.04 to 18.04 last night.",

After searching and trying a lot, I thought it is worth to ask you guys. So thanks in advance for any help. Well the problem is that my case is a combination of \"search strings\" that brings up a lot of different articles but mostly not a matching one for my situation.\n\n## Main problem\n\nOld story the Lets Encrypt Renewal fails in my installation.  \nBut, I can narrow it down a bit.\n\nMostly the thing is:\n\n`https://sub.mydomain.de/.well-known/acme-challenge/`\n\nis not reachable, well it kind of is. When I try hitting it, I see a response but after that, MM sudently redirects internally to some url and answers with something like => \"sorry, site can not be found\". The exact route would be:\n\n`https://sub.mydomain.de/login?redirect_to=%2F.well-known%2Facme-challenge`\n\n### Consequence\n\nThis leads to the problem that Lets Encrypt won't be able to to its renewal routines and this means, some day SSL will fail. I am really looking forward to fix that :wink:\n\n### Ideas\n\nWell as far as I can understand it, there is something wrong with the well-known RewriteRules and ProxyPass Rules. But somehow (cause of the) redirect in the browser it seems like MM is doing something on it self. Maybe any hints on that?\n\n### Config\n\nMM is running in a docker container V 5.22 on a Ubuntu 18 LTS Webserver.  \nI have many domains and subdomains running on my server, also some other docker containers.  \nI am using ISPconfig V 3.1.15 to organize domains, let Lets Encrypt do the work for certs and to link the docker stuff to my domains I usually use the Apache directive option field to set things up.  \nWell, in other cases this works also fine for Lets Encrypt and docker and ProxyPass Rules.\n\nBut in this case, as described above anyhow things get messed up.\n\nHere is my Apache directive\n\n```\nProxyPreserveHost On\nProxyPass /.well-known !\n\n# Set web sockets\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /api/v[0-9]+/(users/)?websocket [NC,OR]\nRewriteCond %{HTTP:UPGRADE} ^WebSocket$ [NC,OR]\nRewriteCond %{HTTP:CONNECTION} ^Upgrade$ [NC]\nRewriteRule .* ws://127.0.0.1:8065%{REQUEST_URI} [P,QSA,L]\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/.well-known/$\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !on\nRewriteRule (.*) https://sub.mydomain.de$1 [R,L]\n\n<Location />\n      Require all granted\n      ProxyPass /.well-known !\n      ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:8065/\n      ProxyPassReverse http://127.0.0.1:8065/\n      ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain 127.0.0.1 sub.mydomain.de\n</Location>\n```\n\nSo I really hope some as a more profound knowledge of ProxyPass than I do and could give me a hint, what I am doing wrong, or maybe where to have a closer look to.\n\nThankfully hoping to get some insights.  \nHave great day.  \nVeit",

I'm not 100% sure if using the STUN/TURN servers will allow for bridging the protocol gap here, but if you're forwarding udp/8443 directly to your Mattermost server, you could try to workaround that by specifying the IPv4 address of your server in the Calls plugin's `ICEHostOverride` setting to check if that changes anything.  \nIf not, we can at least rule out the IPv6 topic I guess.",

An example JSONL entry out of my import file looks like the following (lines broken for readability) with the images in a directory in the zipfile called `ima`.\n\n```\n{\"post\":\n   {\"attachments\":[{\"path\":\"ima/ima_04ea3d5.jpeg\"}],\n    \"channel\":\"techwizardtest\",\n    \"create_at\":1678742223264,\n    \"message\":\"ima_04ea3d5.jpeg\",\n    \"props\":{\n      \"attachments\":[{\"text\":\"image ima_04ea3d5.jpeg\"}]\n    },\n    \"team\":\"ncbt\",\n    \"user\":\"josiah\"},\n \"type\":\"post\"}\n```\n\nSo this isn't quite working\u2013I get all the messages fine, but none of the images appear. I must be missing something with respect to actually getting the media files into Mattermost because when browsing my S3 bucket I don't see any of the images that should be there.\n\nHow can I get the images onto the Mattermost installation and how do I need to reference them in the import file?\n\nThanks!",

The app is seemingly working fine from there, but is there some step of the import process that depends on the app living in opt?\n\nEdit2: We also were using mmctl with --local. Maybe it has trouble importing using local sockets? Retrying with saved creds.\n\nThanks for any help!",

So bin/mmctl instead of running from within bin. Probably didn't matter.\n\nAnd bob's your uncle.\n\nImport ran smoothly, took about 10-15m to complete.\n\nHopefully this helps someone else.

We have a lot of (small) goods coming in. The goods arrive in the incoming goods area, where various people are tasked with processing the goods. In most cases, it's about letting the appropriate person know that something has arrived or if it's unclear who ordered something, to figure out who was responsible. I am looking if we can use Mattermost in an efficient way to communicate about those incoming goods.\n\nWhat I would like to achieve:\n\n  1. Package arrives at incoming goods area.\n  2. Package is photographed e.g. with a webcam.\n  3. With a push of a button (on the camera), the camera takes a picture.\n  4. A mattermost bot publishes the picture on an \"incoming goods\" channel for everybody to see.\n\nAny ideas on how to easily achieve this?",

However, it doesn't seem to work, and users are still having to go to their local settings to set the displayed name to First/Last name.\n\nIs there a way for the admin (me) to set First/Last name as the displayed name on posts, globally? I don't mind that users can override the setting, but I'd like for it to be the initial default when they join.\n\nAlternately, is there a way to expand the number of permitted characters in the nickname? What I really want is for users to be able to set their displayed name to rather long strings, but so far only the First and Last names seem to allow the number of characters some users require.",

Would you be open to help share the following, so we can more easily troubleshoot it:\n\n1. What OS and version is the Mattermost server installed? (E.g.: Ubuntu 16.04, RHEL 7.1)\n2. Are you running Mattermost in a container and/or using container orchestration?\n3. Are multiple people experiencing the same issue after you try to change the default to First/Last name, including a newly created account?\n4. Can you help confirm you are changing the setting in System Console > Users and Teams > Teammate Name Display?\n\nAs for the nickname attribute - this may be related to how the nickname field is defined in the database (set to a max of 22 characters by default). We can verify this.\n\nFor your users, if they can set the First and Last names to long strings, is there a different field they'd like to use for the nickname that is equally as long?",

One possibility is that users may have to update their local settings to reflect this change.\n\nTo address your question about setting First/Last names as the default display name on posts, there may be a way to do this as an admin, although the specific steps would depend on your Mattermost instance's settings and configuration. It's worth checking the Mattermost documentation or reaching out to their support team for guidance on how to achieve this.\n\nAs for allowing longer strings for nicknames, you may also be able to adjust this setting as an admin. Again, this would depend on the specific configuration of your Mattermost instance. It's possible that there may be a limit on the number of characters allowed for nicknames, but it's worth investigating whether this can be expanded.\n\nOverall, it's a good idea to explore the Mattermost documentation and support resources to see if you can find a solution to your issues.",

Then I could do some checking on the ip address. In slack this rest api call is named accessLogs (teams.accessLogs I think). Does mattermost API offer the same, and can you point me to the docs for it?",

It was working very well, including calls for any member of the team.\n\nSome of those members, often use the calls plugins when connected to the server via a Wireguard VPN, also them had no issue reported\u2026\n\nUntil 2 days ago at least\u2026 when we started experiencing random \"timeout waiting for peer connections\" when someone tries to join or start a call from a client connected via VPN. This is very unconsistent sometimes the same person connects or create a call without problems, some time they get the error but if they try again they are ok\u2026 from LAN everything works correctly.\n\nI for example, didn't manage to connect my Android to a single call via VPN, but if I connect my notebook with an hotspot provided by the same phone and connected to THE SAME VPN it does work!\n\nBasically even reproducing the error is a random thing! It's driving me mad! Connections are ok, VPN is stable, devices and server the same.\n\nThe only thing that has changed recently is docker 23\u2026 Could this be the problem?\nI thought that I need a TURN\u2026 but why? If we needed something like this or some misconfiguration was in place it shouldn't have worked on the first place and not in a random way.\n\nI suspect this may be a bug but maybe someone could enlighten me with something I'm not considering.\n\nSome other infos:\n\n  * Mattermost version 7.9.1 was upgraded 2 weeks ago (I think we were on 7.8 a month ago\u2026 could this upgrade bring some bugs?)\n  * Calls plugin version 0.14.1 upgraded from 0.14 while trying to fix the issue\n  * RTCD port directly exposed and reacheable\n  * No STUN/TURN\n  * ICE Host candidate set to server IP\n  * Clients connected to VPN are allowed to reach the server\n  * No network/VPN changes\n  * Android app latest version\n\n\n\nSince I experience the problem just from android I couldn't collect any error from a browser console. I will try to get it from someone experiencing this issue via desktop.\n\nThe only piece of error that I get from the server is\n\n\"level\":\"error\",\"msg\":\"callback failed: call state is missing from channel state\",\"caller\":\"app/plugin_api.go:976\",\"plugin_id\":\"com.mattermost.calls\",\"origin\":\"main.(*Plugin).handleLeave websocket.go:447\"",
