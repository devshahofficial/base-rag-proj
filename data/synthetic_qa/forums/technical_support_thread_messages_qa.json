Fetch all active users using the '/api/v4/users?active=true' endpoint.\n2. For each user, make a separate API call to '/api/v4/users/{user_id}' to get their details.\n3. Extract the 'last_password_update' field from the user details.\n\nA bash one-liner example was provided that demonstrates this process:\n\n```bash\nfor user in $(curl -sX GET -H \"Authorization: Token $TOKEN\" http://localhost:8065/api/v4/users?active=true  | jq -r .[].id); do curl -sX GET -H \"Authorization: Token $TOKEN\" http://localhost:8065/api/v4/users/$user | jq -jr '.|.username,\": \",.last_password_update,\"\\n\"'; done\n```\n\nThis script outputs each user's username and their last password update timestamp (or null if they've never changed their password).",

In this case, the correct configuration would be to point the ClamAV plugin to 172.18.0.2:3310, which is the IP address of the ClamAV container in the shared Docker network.

Instead, you need to set up a web server on your local machine that can accept HTTP calls from the Mattermost server. This web server will act as an intermediary, receiving the slash command requests and then executing the corresponding bash scripts.
