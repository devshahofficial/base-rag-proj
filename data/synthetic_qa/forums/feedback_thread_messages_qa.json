    "answer": "The current Unread Message Indicator in Mattermost shows unread messages in alphabetical order by default, regardless of when they were received. This can cause issues for users communicating in multiple channels simultaneously, as they may not know which channel has the most recent unread message. A suggested solution is to implement a new feature that allows users to configure the unread message indicator to be sorted either alphabetically or based on recency.",

This decision affects smaller organizations, like political parties, who may find it challenging to afford the commercial pricing. While Mattermost Team Edition is ideal for up to 50 users and can work for a couple hundred, features like custom groups are limited to paid tiers. This creates a significant gap between the free version ($0/month) and the lowest commercial tier ($900/month) for organizations that can't qualify for non-profit pricing, potentially putting them at a disadvantage compared to competing platforms like Slack or Discord that offer similar features in their free tiers.",

While some users appreciate this for certain channels, others miss the old style that allowed for a quick overview of new content at a glance.
