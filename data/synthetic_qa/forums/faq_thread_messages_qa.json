    "question": "What error is Bruce encountering when trying to deploy Mattermost on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and what step did he take to try to resolve it?",
    "answer": "Bruce initially encountered an error stating 'Invalid Dockerrun.aws.json version, abort deployment.' To resolve this, he changed the version to 2 in the Dockerrun.aws.json file by setting 'AWSEBDockerrunVersion' to '2'. However, this led to a new error: 'No Docker image specified in either Dockerfile or Dockerrun.aws.json. Abort deployment.' This suggests that while the version issue was addressed, there was still a problem with the Docker configuration in the deployment files.",

    "question": "Can regular users delete channels in Mattermost, and if not, how can channel deletion be performed?",
    "answer": "Regular users cannot delete channels through the Mattermost GUI. Channel deletion is restricted and can only be performed by users with specific permissions using either the API or the mmctl command-line tool. To enable channel deletion, the 'Archive Channels' permission must be granted to the user in the system console, and the 'ServiceSettings.EnableAPIChannelDeletion' must be set to true in the config.json file. Even with these settings, channel deletion can only be executed via the API or mmctl, not through the standard user interface.",

    "answer": "In Mattermost Pro or Enterprise, you can create a channel for communication and add freelancers as guest users with access only to that specific channel. This way, you can communicate with each freelancer in the channel, and they will only be able to direct message members of channels they are part of, preventing interaction between freelancers. This setup is similar to using external connections and 1:1 messages in Slack.",

    "question": "What is the main challenge with removing built-in emojis in Mattermost, and why might this approach no longer be valid?",
    "answer": "The main challenge with removing built-in emojis in Mattermost is that it requires editing minified JavaScript files, which can be risky and may cause UI issues such as emoji misalignment. This approach is no longer valid as of Mattermost v5.37, as stated by Stu Doherty. The process involves identifying the emoji to remove, editing specific files in the Mattermost installation directory, and replacing the unwanted emoji with a transparent image. However, this method is considered advanced and should be used with caution, as it needs to be reapplied after each Mattermost server upgrade and can potentially cause problems in highly-available Mattermost clusters.",
