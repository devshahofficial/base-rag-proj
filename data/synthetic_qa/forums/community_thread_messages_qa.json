    "question": "Can user profiles in Mattermost be customized with additional fields like city, company division, or social media interests?",
    "answer": "Yes, Mattermost allows for customization of user profiles. While the default fields are somewhat limited, administrators can add custom fields to user profiles. This can be done through the System Console under 'User Management' > 'Custom User Attributes'. Admins can create various types of fields such as text inputs, dropdowns, or even long-form text areas. These custom fields can include information like city, company division, social media handles, or personal interests. However, the level of customization might not be as extensive as Slack's profile revamp mentioned in the Computerworld article. It's worth noting that the exact implementation and available options may vary depending on your Mattermost version and deployment setup.",

    "question": "What issue did the user encounter when trying to log in to Mattermost after creating the first user with mmctl, and how was it resolved?",
    "answer": "The user created the first user (sysadmin) using the mmctl command line tool with the --local switch, but was unable to log in to the web interface, receiving an 'invalid email/username or password' error. The issue was resolved by enclosing the password string with single quotes when using the mmctl command line tool.",

    "question": "How can you restrict Mattermost login based on Active Directory (AD) group membership?",
    "answer": "While the user attempted to use a custom 'User Filter' with a NOT filter in the AD/LDAP settings, this method did not effectively restrict login based on AD group membership. The initial login showed an error message, but subsequent attempts allowed access. As of Mattermost Enterprise 9.2.2, there doesn't appear to be a straightforward way to restrict Mattermost login based solely on AD group membership using the described method. Further investigation or consultation with Mattermost support may be necessary to find a proper solution for this requirement.",
