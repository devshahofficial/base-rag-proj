    "answer": "The 401 error is likely caused by the server interpreting the request as a CSRF attempt. This is probably due to navigator.sendBeacon() behaving differently from fetch().

    "answer": "The 401 error is likely caused by the server interpreting the request as a CSRF attempt. This is probably due to navigator.sendBeacon() behaving differently from fetch().
